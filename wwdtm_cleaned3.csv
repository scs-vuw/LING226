Unfortunately, this phenomenon isn't anything new. A Stanford scholar recently published an article on one of the first betting scandals ever recorded in sports. In Scotland, where it is believed the earliest curling leagues were organized, a 16th century Scottish curling team, led by legendary Fergus Magnuson, became local heroes after a winning streak led them to a spot in the regional finals. However, after what seemed to be an embarrassing loss to their weaker Glasgow rivals, questions were raised. An investigation revealed that the entire team had thrown the match in exchange for a rather unusual bribe offered by a fanatic and extremely wealthy supporter of the other side.

It's a very simple concept, explains lead engineer Sarah Chen (ph). No one wants to cause a scene by calling someone out for their scent, so our solution is both effective and, more importantly, anonymous. Each strap and handle on a train car is equipped with a special mechanism which, when activated by a subtle twist and pull motion, dispenses a pleasant fragrant mist which deodorizes the area immediately around the olfactorily affected passenger. (LAUGHTER)  While attempts have been made to alleviate train stench in the past, this is the first to be passenger-operated.

Turn it on, count sheep, and you'll drift right off. But as soon as Nina started using it, she started waking up in the middle of the night screaming in a cold sweat alongside her partner, Nigel Smyth (ph), who'd likewise be clutching her and hyperventilating - all this while their daughter, Mercury Bacon-Smyth (ph), kept sleeping like - well, like a baby. Her mum friends and their partners were having the same problem - nighttime terrors. No one knew why. One night, after baby Mercury was extra fussy, Nina tried to lull herself back to sleep and turned the Sleep Sheep up to 11. As she sat listening to the swishy, uterus-y (ph) sounds, she heard a deep male voice - or did she? As she listened super-duper closely, she could barely make out the sheep singing in a baritone. The tune was like a soothing nursery rhyme with horrifying lyrics about devouring a baby. (LAUGHTER)  It was sung in this really creepy voice, Nina says.

What is our purpose? How many roads must a man walk down before you can call him a man? And the biggest question of all - which way do I place the toilet paper on the toilet paper holder? You could go with the end of the roll draped over the top, causing the paper to cascade over the front like a pillow-y (ph) waterfall. Or you can go with the end of the roll tucked discreetly under the roll itself, allowing for a more restrained and modest unfurling. You don't care which way your toilet paper emerges from its cushiony, two-ply cocoon? Pick a side, you coward.The over-under debate has raged for years. It has led to unmendable rifts betwixt roommates. It has laid waste to marriages and even sparked the bloody Iberian toilet paper wars of the late 1950s, which is why the people at the magazine Choice - a sort of Australian Consumer Reports - decided to settle this vexing issue once and for all. This week, they published an incendiary article featuring a recently discovered patent from 1891 for the original toilet paper roll. It included a detailed 128-year-old pictograph which showed definitive proof of proper paper placement over the top of the roll - over. (CHEERING)  Thank you. It was a stunning proclamation. After today, mankind shall never be the same. Brother will no longer fight against brother.

100,2019-02-16T00:00:00Z,Luke Burbank,43,Male,Undergrad,Yes,Radio host,1,Mooooooom (ph).,0,0,"A potential disaster was narrowly averted last week when two armed F-18 Hornets were scrambled to respond to an airborne disturbance over an elementary school in the town of Sedro- Woolley, Wash. We didn't know if it was going to be al-Qaida or aliens, pilot John Bolden told the Skagit Valley Herald. It just looked like a cluster of some kind of small war craft on the radar. It turned out to be something much more sinister, five drones being piloted by five different parents watching their kids play during recess. (LAUGHTER)  Apparently, things started when Jan Saperstein, the mom of Braden, a fourth-grader, heard from her son that the other kids were cheating at tetherball. Using a drone camera that her older son, Kaden, had, quote, ""begged for and then never used, not even once,"" Jan did uncover rampant tetherball and hopscotch cheating and even photo documented it, sending the drone pics to the school administrators. This led to a number of the accused kids' parents buying their own drones to gather their own evidence. The number eventually grew to five, known in aviation circles as an overparenting of drones. (LAUGHTER)  The mid-air dogfights that had started breaking out posed a real danger to the students.

The British tabloids called her Dr. Pippy (ph) long darts. (LAUGHTER)  The semi-final round started like any other. Dr. Gurtson and her challenger Charles Cook (ph) walked out and shook hands. By the second round, Charles Cook was visibly sweating and also whispering to each dart before he threw them. His last six throws missed the target entirely. Things looked good for the American, but then her behavior also became erratic. She start gazing at each dart, turn them around, touching the point with her thumb and then seemed surprised each time that they were sharp. Finally, the match was called on account of both contestants not being able to continue. Finally, the disorientated Dr. Gurtson admitted to the truth.

When the popular troupe Bisan SuperFire (ph) swung through the Osaka-jo arena, Kai Jo saw his chance to get up close and personal with his idols. Nakamura laid low, and then, once the show started, he sprung into action.

They lost their mascot. For almost two decades, Lyudia (ph) was the 6-foot star of the rundown zoo, attracting thousands of visitors. She could sign hundreds of words and loved to catch bananas from the kids who'd wave at her. She could even break dance. So when she dearly departed, management feared the zoo would also die from lack of attendance. There was only one thing to do - keep Lyudia's demise a secret and stuff zookeeper Merick Cep (ph) into a gorilla suit. (LAUGHTER)  Cep threw himself into his role wholeheartedly. From opening to closing time for the past month, he played Lyudia, even going so far as to pretend to pick nits out of the hair of his colleagues who came to feed him - or her. But the jig was up when 6-year-old Andras Pavlov (ph) attended the zoo with his camp last week and threw a banana to the ape man he thought was Lyudia. The gorilla moonwalked away from it. Another kid threw her banana. They all had bananas in their lunch that day. And soon the gorilla was scampering all over the cage wildly dodging bananas until, little Andras says, the gorilla kept showing us her middle finger.

But it seems the publishing world wasn't quite ready for an epic survival story about a man who is allergic to peanuts but somehow gets trapped inside of a Skippy factory and has to maneuver his way out before succumbing to anaphylactic shock. (LAUGHTER)  He had been rejected by 37 publishers and was starting to doubt his skills as a storyteller. Perhaps the novel needed some jokes in between the harrowing drama? He took his only hard copy of the novel, which he had printed at home and hand bound in leather, and headed to his favorite hiking trail for some inspiration. On the trail, he came upon another hiker who had fallen off one of the steep ridges and was moaning in pain. They determined that the injured woman had broken her leg and would need a splint to help her get back down the hill. After hesitating for just a moment, Mr. Fincher whipped his leather-bound novel out of his backpack and secured it tightly around the injured woman's leg. The two made it back to safety and called paramedics. Recognizing the awkwardness of asking for his novel back, Ian watched his now-bloodstained life's work get loaded onto a stretcher and carted off in an ambulance. But, it seems, this is what turned the hapless writer's luck around. The injured woman was none other than Mary Fayish (ph) of Fayish Books (ph).

It all started innocently 20 years ago with her going to Sunday mass at the Sacred Heart Catholic Church at Topeka to hear Father Stevens deliver his sermons. She found herself daydreaming about Stevens' message, how he made transubstantiation sound so sultry and seductive but, like, in a God-fearing way. Things started getting a bit more serious for her when she started going to Saturday mass as well. Two days in a row of watching Father Stevens fill out his cassock and wave the censer and she found herself thinking not so much of the kingdom of God as the hotness of him. She started going to confessional once a week and then every day. Not having many new sins to confess, they would chat about her life, their mutual interests and fun stuff like the pope's latest encyclical. After two full decades of chaste conversation, she said screw it. If God is love, he has to be down with this. So she went to confessional one day and laid bare her dirty, dirty soul by asking Father Stevens to marry her right through the screen.

Heated, massaging seats, autonomous driving, Wi-Fi, talk-to-text. Every new feature is obsolete as soon as it's released. GM polled luxury car buyers to find out what they really wanted, and they were surprised by one result. What people really wanted from their cars was being able to get out of them. Namely, they hate searching for parking. So in their new unnamed Cadillac prototype, the GM car will come with a drone that you can release from the roof compartment. It can fly ahead, find and hold a parking space for you. Raymond Raven (ph), Cadillac director of technology, explains, these days with all the distractions available, people only notice they're even driving a car when it becomes miserable. And it is the most miserable when you can't find a place to park. You ever been at Trader Joe's on a Saturday? (LAUGHTER)  The technology is excellent. Using a combination of GPS, cameras and computer algorithms, the drones can recognize rectangles of bare asphalt. The drones are finding and hovering over these empty parking spaces with a 98 percent success rate. The only problem is other drivers. Road testers have pulled up to their quote, ""reserved parking space"" to find other drivers smashing the drone to pieces with baseball bats...

In court on Monday, he faced, among other charges, allegations he billed nearly $2 million in intravenous sedation without proper justification, that he illegally diverted funds from his employer and he performed a tooth extraction while standing on a hoverboard, filmed it and texted it to others. (LAUGHTER) While medical fraud is an important topic, I think I speak for everyone when I say let's hear more about the hoverboard.  (LAUGHTER)  For those of you who don't have teenagers or watch YouTube videos of other people's teenage disasters, a hoverboard is an electric skateboard you balance on, zips in whatever direction you lean even slightly and occasionally catches fire or even explodes. In other words, not an approved dental instrument but probably more fun for the dentist than the old knee on your chest extraction method. Of course, it's just this kind of pioneering spirit that built America's last frontier and exactly the cuckoo logic that gave us moose turd souvenirs - goose, a grizzly day and Governor Palin. (LAUGHTER)  There is no law against goosing (ph) a bear, selling moose poop or probably pulling someone's tooth while riding a hoverboard.

(LAUGHTER)  That's right, Senor Santa Kwanzukkah - part Latin, part Black, Christian and Jewish, but all Santa. Travis wore a West African dashiki, a Native American dream catcher, German lederhosen, a yarmulka and skinny jeans so he would not offend the white girls. (LAUGHTER)  They even had him ride in on a two-wheel hoverboard because using reindeer was offensive to animals. (LAUGHTER)  But that's when things got out of hand.

Of course, the story doesn't end here. Whenever Jeff is flying a client from the entertainment industry, he bombards them with demos through the PA. He really looks forward to transcontinental flights because then he can get deep into his catalog. Passengers have used the term hostage. Stars like P.

Scott Fitzgerald in the nose. But literary feuds just don't get the attention they used to, until bookselling factory James Patterson upped the ante this week when he announced his latest book. And the title - ""The Murder Of Stephen King."" Patterson has never met Stephen King, but his book imagined someone doing bodily harm to the horror master. The story, which he swears is fictional, takes place in King's house in Maine. In an excerpt, he described King as having a rabbit-like face.

He wanted to be buried dressed as Batman. In fact, it was a stipulation in his will. So you can understand why his family was so shocked when they arrived at Striker's wake and saw that he had been dressed in the wrong year Batman. Striker was a big fan of the 1960s television show starring Adam West, and the funeral director, Charles Hunter, had him dressed as ""Dark Knight"" starring Christian Bale. Striker's mother Florence said, it's hard enough losing Jeff and now this. He hated the new Batman. It's been a bad week. Funeral director Hunter said, I'm 32 years old. I've never even seen the television version. But before you could say holy embalmment, Hunter apologized and asked if he could make it up to his family. He asked if he could add one more day to the viewing, free of charge, and then Striker would be dressed as the correct version of the winged, caped crime fighter before being lowered into God's bat cave.

My GPS is broken.,0,1,"For years, Japan's birthrate has been plummeting. But just last month, government officials gleefully announced the birthrate is starting to show the tiniest bump. Ninety-two-thousand babies were born December, up 27 percent from the previous year. Government officials are lighting cigars over this news because it was they who conceived a new children's television show dedicated to giving parents a half hour to make babies. The state-run show is called Peko Peko Arcachon, which roughly translates to baby time. It began airing last year, and immediately became a national tradition. Millions of kiddies in footie pajamas sit on their tatami mats in front of the TV. Their parents turn it on, then close their bedroom door to get it on. The host of the show is an adorable anime blastocyst called Pokeyourmom. (LAUGHTER) Pokeyourmom keeps the children of Japan riveted, offering them plenty of action while their parents get some action. Every episode features role play with chopsticks, sticky rice snowball fights, songs about not knocking on mommy's door. (LAUGHTER) Instead of commercials, the friendly day-five blastocyst reminds kids to go the potty and brush their teeth. And at the 22-minute mark, it's the climax of the show...

All went well for Bacal as the terrified teller promptly offered him stacks of hundred-dollar bills, which she stuffed into the Whole Foods tote he provided. But just before making what would've been a clean getaway, Bacal, whose only prior criminal record was a college arrest for disturbing the peace when his a cappella group got drunk, couldn't resist celebrating his heist with a selfie - selfie-brating, if you will. Pulling up his mask and brandishing some Benjamins, he smiled for himself on his iPhone 6 Plus. As he paused to add a filter, he heard sirens - extremely loud and incredibly close. He dropped his phone and ran, essentially leaving behind a high- resolution, megapixelled most wanted poster.

Critics panned at star Daniel Craig's stoic acting but praised the action sequences. But now it looks like some backstage drama might upstage the on-screen action. Daniel Craig is suing Roger Smith (ph), a former sound technician, over leaked audiotapes where the movie star can be heard shrieking, crying and screaming as he's performing stunts in the film. In one action sequence, Craig is dangled upside down over Mexico City as he clings to a helicopter.

This week, Dr. Paul Booth, a historian at Keele University in England, found what just may be the earliest reference, dating from the year 1310, of the word fork, which is, again, not to actual word.

Booth thinks the nickname could actually refer to an attempt at fornication by the inexperienced young Roger, who chose the navel as his, let's say, point of entry with a young lady. The embarrassing episode may have later been reported by Roger's confused and presumably very dissatisfied girlfriend, which led to the unfortunate nickname.

We see about three guys for every 10 women and two of them just came to meet the women, said Ford. Some guys get talked into it by their wives and girlfriends, show up once and never come back. Ford and Kahn's breakthrough idea came when one of these guys complained, nobody wins at this game, what's the point of it? Say hello to boga (ph), competitive yoga for men who don't do yoga. Not to be confused with broga (ph), which is yoga for annoying men who do do yoga. (LAUGHTER)  Unlike yoga yoga, which is done on sticky mats, boga yoga is done on slippery mats that are soaped down before every session. Contestants are required to hold standard yoga poses, such as downward dog and tree, without falling down until the whistle is blown. There are three rounds, with the final round being a last man standing bent over on one foot closer.

When he was a little kid, if his mom dropped anything, Timmy raced to pick it up. (LAUGHTER) It sort of became a game between he and his mom. She'd drop things on purpose to see how quick he could grab them. Growing up, Timmy volunteered at local tennis tournaments, making it as far as the preliminary rounds of a pro tournament in nearby Indian Wells, Calif.

And of course, it was going to be classic tennis white, the only color professional tennis shoes should be. Turns out, not many shared Timmy's ball boy dream as the shoe was a colossal failure, and Timmy was moved back to the sock division. (LAUGHTER)

(LAUGHTER)  I'm the guy in the driver's seat. But you may have noticed that we never actually drive anywhere. We're like two characters in a Beckett play about hamburgers. (LAUGHTER)  This has been to my advantage over the years because I cannot drive. I grew up in New York. I went to college, and I lived in Chicago for 15 years. I live in New York now, and so I just never learned how to drive. This hadn't been an issue until this week, when the good people from Sonic came up with an idea for a commercial that started with me driving the car into the parking spot. I was too embarrassed to admit to my lack of motor skills, so I said sure, I'll do it, figuring - how hard could it be? Well, for me, the answer turned out to be very, very hard.

The only problem was that all the bouncies near the village had already been rented out. So, in an effort to build their own bouncy, the committee stormed the oldest castle in the village and laid out mattresses in every room, giving all the citizens of Ramygala the chance to bounce 'til they dropped. And dropped they did. While the younger Ramygalians were able to bounce 'til sundown, the older ones had some problems. Eighty-four-year-old Aldona Augustus (ph) stated, I had no business jumping up and down on stupid mattress. Mattress is for sleeping on, not for jumping on. Give me a Vicodin. (LAUGHTER)  However, the organizers stood by their decision, pointing out how well the kids of the village slept that night.

A reference to the year Sweden dropped its anti-gay laws, but also begging the question, what were you Russian guys up to in 1944? Oh, right - Stalin.

Based on the Scared Straight experiment of the 1970s, where juvenile offenders were subjected to threats and ridicule by hard-core prison inmates, Climate Camp is intended to frighten kids who commit crimes against the environment into changing their ways. At St. Francis, those crimes include taking more than one paper napkin in the cafeteria, not using both sides of a homework paper, or God save the children, being caught putting recyclables in the trash.

The user wears an earpiece and a computerized programmable bracelet with which they select from a menu of settings where they might be in conversation and relationships of whom they might be in conversation with - fellow employee, boss, casual stranger, et cetera. The bracelet reads the pulse of the user and based on pulse, setting and relationship, it identifies the feelings of the user and tells them, through the headpiece, exactly what to say.

They get performance reviews, bonuses for good grades and occasionally get laid off to increase parental profits. (LAUGHTER) Then they have to apply for a new job in the family.

The wholesome wife and mother of two was excited when she learned about a Betty Crocker sponsored baking contest for the first prize of $10,000. Her family desperately needed a new car and the prize would cover the station wagon they'd had their eye on. Sally was usually confident in her chocolate chip brownies, which were famous in her small town, but started to worry when she learned how many people from across the state would be competing. She really needed that car, so she started experimenting with her recipe to make her brownies the undeniable favorites. Well, it worked. After serving the four judges a large helping of her super sweet and salty brownies, they each started circling back for seconds, thirds and then, even fourths. Twenty minutes later, the lead judge announced that Sally was the winner of the first-place cash prize, but other contestants got suspicious when he went on to say that Sally was also being nominated for best rainbow unicorn. (LAUGHTER): That's when they noticed the other judges lying on the floor giggling in front of Sally's station and one judge trying to order a pizza delivery into a paper cup. Yes it turns out Sally's secret ingredient was pot and she'd whipped up a batch of extra delicious pot brownies using weed she'd bought from her son's gym teacher. The cops were called and Sally was arrested and disqualified from the competition. There is a happy ending this story however - a marijuana dispensary in Colorado heard about the contest and ordered millions of her brownies. Sally now drives an Audi convertible.

He especially hated how his two Siamese cats - Ba Ling and Jackie Chan Ling - kept getting kitty litter stuck in between their toes. Knowing that his beloved felines hated water and would freak out every time he dug into their little paws, he was perplexed. Then one stormy night while sipping a glass of Malbec as Ling and Chan were enjoying their catnip, Ling jumped up on Jonas and rolled over on her back, paws up. Taking advantage of the situation, Jonas grabbed a Q-tip and some wet ones and figured out a way to give Ling a waterless pedicure. He was elated, but felt that something was missing. What his cats needed was a nice coat of nail polished to complete the look. The following day, Jonas called up his good friend Essie Winegarden, president and founder of Essie Nail Polish. She loved the idea of a catnip pedicure.

The two had been talking about getting engaged for a few months when Mark bought a ring and booked a romantic trip to a luxury beach resort. Their first activity was a couples massage - an extravagance they'd both been looking forward to. When the respective massage therapist came out to greet them, they were tickled to learn that the therapist were themselves a married couple - Greg and Misty Jones. Once on their tables, Mark and Nora were excited to relax when Misty somewhat snippily asked Greg why he hadn't remembered to replenish the aromatherapy oils. Maybe because I've been really busy dealing with car insurance after you totaled the Subaru, Greg sniped as he rubbed Mark's feet adding, Mark, tell me if this pressure is OK? (LAUGHTER) Oh, are you trying to say you can't be responsible because of my driving, Misty huffed as she worked on Nora's neck. Raising his voice, Greg barked, no. I'm saying you need to get off my back. The bickering escalated until Misty finally blurted out she didn't love Greg anymore and wanted a divorce to which Greg responded that was great 'cause he wasn't even sure if he'd ever loved Misty.

Until Susan happened to look up and see a highly agitated alpha-male sea elephant moving its enormous, blubbery mass across the sand towards them at a surprising and alarming speed. At first, calling upon his extensive knowledge of sea elephant behavior, Mauer suggested they lay dormant and submissive. It worked it to a point, says Winter. The male lost interest in Neil as a threat right away, but then I realized he thought he had won me in the standoff. Neil then tried to mimic challenging sea elephant behavior, putting his elbow on his head, dropping his fist vertically over his nose to look like a male proboscis, and vocalizing and lunging. But I could see the look on that sea elephant's face. He wanted me in his harem. Finally, I just yelled, forget about science - run to the car.

At New York City's Copacabana Club, Jones was working the crowd when all of the sudden a woman stood up, peeled off her panties and hurled them at a stunned Jones. So the next year, when Jones was getting a lukewarm reception at Vegas' Flamingo Hotel, Bernstein, armed with a fat wad of Benjamins, rounded up a bunch of women to fling their knickers at Tom Jones.

Even in the 1870s, humans were obsessed with ridiculous photos of cats. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER) : Long before dogs began playing poker on velvet paintings, the dignity of the domesticated feline was doomed. Probably the first person to blame for silly cat pictures was English photographer Harry Pointer, who snapped approximately 200 photos of his perplexed, albeit jovial, Brighton cats. Pointer often arranged his cats in poses that mimic human activity. A cat riding a tricycle or cats roller skating was what people loved.

The good doctor had accepted his fate until two weeks ago when he was driving home from the hospital and came upon a terrible accident. A school bus had flipped upside down in a ditch, trapping the children inside. Thinking fast, Dr. Baarf retrieved an ax from his trunk and smashed open several windows, allowing every single child to crawl out to safety. Well, Tipton, Indiana laughs no longer.

Only you, with $100 million of your tax dollars, can prevent forest fires. Citing the current wildfires raging in the West and in a whip-like government response to the 1988 fire in Yellowstone National Park, which destroyed one-third of the forest there, Wyoming Senator Michael Enzi has attached an earmark to a routine spending bill calling for the installation of a thousand-square- mile, automatic sprinkler system in America's national treasure. We have sprinklers in our schools and businesses; why not in our precious parks, said national park spokesman Jamie Rios, not pausing for a reporter to offer 100 million reasons why not. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER): The Yellowstone River has all the water we need, and tapping into the dozens of natural geysers will keep the system charged. Rios claims the hundreds of miles of plastic pipe gurgling hot water every hour or so will be a comfort rather than a nuisance for jumpy visitors. It's like having a million tiny Old Faithfuls.
