One day last week
 One day last week,  I made up my mind to go hiking with my sister  we just  have  some clothing not clothing, foods and drink some  something to drink And  my sister insisted to drive a car Because she just got a new one  we went to  some I don't know, Tone River I don't know
Tone River 
Some river And  also, we just brought a camp  we decided to stay overnight there Because it's very warm day And the sun very fresh air  my sister was in girl scout  she said she could do it She  and  actually, she was very  good at building a tent But too suddenly,  we had a rain I thought it was a little bit  just  s  not so strong rain or heavy rain  we said " We can stay here" But suddenly, it was a storm or typhoon And  all the stuffs are just crushed and  just blown away  we just  went into the car And  escaped from the river And  wow to make it worse,  there was a thunder  we couldn't go back to the our house Because  there was some accident on the road And  we couldn't go any further But  very fortunately, we have just found us a so some hotel, Hotel Cosmos And  very luckily,  we had a vacant room And  lastly,  we could have a very  nice  black coffee And in the very safe room
But i actually it was a haunted mansion 
Maybe at the seventh picture
