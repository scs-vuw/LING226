 my friend and I ww were preparing to go on a camp  and then just go on
  we left early in the morning, and arrived at the camp site before noontime And we enjoyed preparing the food for lunch, setting up the tent And just as we were looking forward to our lunch, we heard thunder storm well no, raining the sound of rain "Oh-oh" And then the tent was blown away Our food was vanished we escaped inside the car, and we found a nice hotel instead And looking at the bright side of it, the whole story, we ended up in a nice hotel room, bright sunshine the next morning with comfortable environment, enjoying tea
Or maybe thi no, this is maybe night time, well could be morning
