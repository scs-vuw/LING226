 last weekend, I and my friend, Yuko went camping  we had been looking forward to it very much because  we ha we planned it long time ago And since al both of us were really busy, it was really difficult to meet the on a day to which date   Yuko actually as Yuko has a tent, she brought her own tent and I prepared food  we packed lots of food and  tools to cook  When we arrived in the camping site, the weather was really nice  we set up a tent and started oh cooking our dinner But suddenly, it started raining First, we thought it  was temporary raining 
But  there was a thunder storm and  it seemed like a storm
 we decided to pack every stuff  into my car but as the wind was too strong to   put all of them into the car, so we had we were strung struggling to gather them scattering on the road 
when we were dri driving to find a place where we res took a rest, we found a nice hotel called "Cosmos"
 we decided to stay in that hotel Fortunately, there was a room for us  we checked in a hotel in the hotel and finally, we could relax, having a coffee after taking a shower
