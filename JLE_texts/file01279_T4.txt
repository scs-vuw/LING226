Let's see One day last week, my friend my friend, Naomi and I  went camping   in order to do that, we had prepared lots of camping gears  including tents and foods and everything And we packed everything, we loaded everything in the back of the seat of my car, which was yellow And   it was Oregon State in the United States   we went to the   near Mount Saint Helen Then we pitched tent Everything went all right  Naomi san knew exactly what she had to do to pitch a tent I start cooking  I think that was  curry rice  it looked really fun Then all of the sudden, it start to ra it started to rain And  I was really worry because you can't p you couldn't predict the  the weather of the mountain But Naomi said, "No, it's all right Let's keep doing that"  however, maybe thirty minutes later, it  the wind began to be really strong And  tent blown away Everything's just blown away because the  wind was so strong  we just rush into the car  try to wait a little bit But  the way the wind and storm didn't stop  we decided to move along We start drivi we started to drive And we happened to find a nice, cozy hot  hotel called "Hotel Cosmos"  we decided to check in  fortunately, the room was available   we stayed there And we took a shower and have a nice cup of coffee
