One  one day last week, 
we went to a camp
with my friend
   we went by car
and went to a riverside and made up a tent And we were having fun But then it started to rain
And it got  pretty wild
And so we had to g go back to the car
And we s we looked for some place to stay
that night
And we found a hotel  near the riverside  we stayed there instead of staying sleeping in the in a tent
