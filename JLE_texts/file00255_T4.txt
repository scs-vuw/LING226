One day last week, at eight o'clock in the morning,   Suzuki   is on his way to work as usual And he got to the station And  it is  really crowded  as the usual morning And he was standing  next to  two   two gentlemen And  the two people were really engaged in  a conversation And  one guy unintentionally hit  Suzuki And  Suzuki dropped his  his bag  to the  railroad And  Suzuki claimed to the person But there was nothing they can do ,  they were just   standing And there comes a train And  Suzuki  went almost crazy, because  he thought it might crash his  bag Maybe  something  important was in his bag And after passing the train, the bag was still there And  Suzuki seemed really relieved Then came the   personnel of the station And  pick  picked   Suzuki's bag And, again, everything was settled
