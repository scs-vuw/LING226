One day last week, I went to a department store to buy a happy birthday present for my husband  I thought a tie would be nice and I just straight go to the tie section, and I found a very nice  green tie with  brown dots And I it was although it was a little expensive, I didn't bother to bu pay a lot of money because that's a present  I asked the sales clerk to wrap  it as a present And he wrap it nicely with a red ribbon And I paid in cash And on the way back home I in the department store, I found a final sale of shoes  it was written san three percent off And "Oh," I thought, "it's cheap" And I was so glad  I bought a pair of shoes for my for me And then next  section, I found  fifty percent off sales of clothes for ladies And I was so happy And I bought a very nice  yellow sweater  when I went out to the department store, I end up with buying a lot of things for myself and one nice gift for my husband
