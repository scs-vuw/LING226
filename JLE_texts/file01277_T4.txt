one day last week, a man was driving his car he was going to his friend's place  for a party And from the other side, there came a mo  a young guy driving a motorbike And he was talking to his girlfriend on the cellphone And because he was talking to his girlfriend on the cellphone, he wasn't watching where he was going And he bumped into this car and dropped his cell phone and broke it at first this young guy on the motorbike complained that it's this other guy's fault that he broke his cellphone and his motorbike But this guy guess I should have named him, 
this guy didn't agree to this young man  they decided to call the policeman And they explained the situation to the policeman And the man on the car claimed that  it's not his fault that this accident happened so I guess they decided to  I don't know, maybe they decided to talk about it some other day, because this man on the car was in a rush And the guy on the motorbike called the truck and asked them to tow away his  motorbike and repair it
