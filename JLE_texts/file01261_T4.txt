One day last week, a mother and her daughter were planning to go camping
And they were excited about it, packing up everything they would need for camp
And they went, set their tent But the weather got bad It started raining and then storms  hit soon They had to clean up and go right away to somewhere where they could find shelter And so on their way in the car, they found a hotel  they were up by hotel and stayed at the hotel instead
