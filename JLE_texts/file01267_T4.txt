One day last week  I make past sentences  There was a Japanese man  walking to a station around eight o'clock in the morning He usually  take train to go to his office every morning And it is probably wintertime  when the temperature is below ten degrees Celsius  this is the daily thing he usually   does And like many other Japanese stations  in Tokyo, there are many people waiting at the  station And he was this Japanese businessman was one of the person who were who was standing in front of the lines And there was a couple of Japanese businessmen who are talking to each other It seems that they are talking into something very seriously And at one moment, one of the guy who was next to this Japanese man move his arm and it hit this Japanese man's business bag very badly And as a result, his bag was fallen onto the  the rail And it was a ac it was an accident And it seems that the guy who hit this Japanese man, let's call him Hiroshi, Hiroshi,  to say "I'm sorry It was an accident" And people around Hiroshi was also looking at them and wondering what would happen in the next And since this was a rush hour in the morning, there was a train passing by this this station This train wasn't supposed to stop  the conductor on the train didn't have time to stop the the the train just for this bus  just for Hiroshi's  bag on the railway  the conductor had to move on And everyone was almost screaming that his bag was ran by this train But few seconds later, after the train passed the station, everybody was relieved to see that his ca his bag Hiroshi's bag was still there without any damages And everyone was so happy that it wasn't really bad accident Just his bag lying on the railway And as soon as the train left the station, the dor this person who's working for the the station came down to the railway to pick up Hiroshi's bag and bring it back to him And everyone was staring at what was going on and see nothing really bad happened  some of them were even clapping their hands
for the happy-end
