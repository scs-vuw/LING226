One day last week, I was walking to the station because I had to go to work It was eight o'clock and since it was so early in the morning, there were so many people and it was very crowded I was waiting for the train to come And wait, I was waiting for the train to come and so I was behind a man who was lining up before me Well he was talking to another person and he didn't know that I was behind him  he lifted his arm quite hard and fast that the luggage that I was holding, it fell off to the tra wait, t trail trail, oh man, I forgot what this is called
it fell  I got so angry and start yelling at the man But the man just said, "I don't know" And raised his hands Well ten seconds later, the train came and it ran over my or I thought it ran over my luggage But thank God, it didn't And it was just lying there like it was before the train got there I called the train man and told him what happened And when I told him, he picked it up for me and gave it gave me the luggage Everybody was happy and so was I
