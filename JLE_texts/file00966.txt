One day last week, I was driving a car and then the a bike who a man was driving a bike and was calling with a mobile phone and when I tried to turn to the left, I bumped into his bike And the and then the bike was broken, but not so bad But the man who was on the bike, argued, as like it was my all my fault  I was very upset because he was not concentrating how to drive or whether he was driving safely and I was very upset because he was calling with a mobile phone and I think he shouldn't do that  when the police came, I talked to the policemen that he was calling while he was driving the bike And then the police understood the situation and the bike was taken away for   and the bike was  taken with the truck,
and everybody everything was settled down
