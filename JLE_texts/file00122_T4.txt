One day last week, my friends, Jack and Bill came to my house, and we talked about something to do And we just opened a magazine And Jack found, "Oh there is a very exciting film now on Yokohama  should we go there?"  I said, "Oh,  it's a good idea" And Bill also agreed  we immediately went out  to buy the tickets Fortunately, yes, we bought the three tickets, and had had some drinks beverages "Oh the film was really very exciting And big planes and just a Tom Cruise also was on the show Oh good, good"  three of us were very satisfied And we say and I said, "Oh Jack, Bill, bye bye And maybe we can see next time"
