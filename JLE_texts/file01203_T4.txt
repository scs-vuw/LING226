One day last week, a man businessman called, say, he  must be then Japanese man, Takagi Mister Takagi went to the  station And he want to take  he has to take his train It is eight o'clock eight-five And it happened that he had  or just because his   man standing right next to him sho g gave gave them gave him the  was his elbow pushed him so that his bag, which was quite important,  fell off right on the  rails in between And it was behind it and he wanted to hi wanted him to take it, but wh wh d di the ner the man next to him was quite mean, and he wouldn't take it, right? And then in the meantime, people were around  just watching them and it was quite embarrassing But nonetheless he wouldn't do it Now, it happened that that the train came right in it  it this moment, and the Takagi Mister Takagi thought, you know, his  bag which  say his case briefcase, how do you say, his brief case? His case were beaten and just torn off But  he was so relieved well so am I,  because I he had in his  briefcase the whole reports of the  you know, bu important business negotiation and he was so relieved And the man well man next to him was also nice enough to have this to share this relief
And then the  now  it happened that the   railroad  man working at the railroad, how I try to call him, I don't know,  would come up and then, you know, saved this briefcase and handed to him And he was so relieved And interestingly enough,  one man who was clapping his hand was different from the man next to him But I don't know why they i  it happen quite often in Ger in Japan, and people ww would watch it, but wouldn't just do or they wouldn't say anything, right?
He could have  call or the ca call in the help  because actually he was the one who was  responsible for this what happened
And now
Everyone's  and then, you know, but they're everybody was satisfied and happy
 it was the happy end
