One day last week,  Taro was  going his office  he was a freshman, he just entered the company And that day was the first time for him to go to his office  he got up early in the morning And he arrived at  the station But  on the platform,  he dropped his  briefcase  on the rail And  actually,  the guy  who was talking the old guy who was talking to his co-worker  pushed his hand, that's why he dropped his briefcase  he put too much blame on the old guy, and he complained about a lot about it And also the train   came came to the platform and then his luggage was  run over by the train And then  but fortunately,  his luggage  was  safe And then and finally, he asked the station clerk to pick his baggage  pick up his baggage And then but I think it's it was kind of  problem because he was lack of  sociability because he shouldn't have put such too much claim on the old guy And that that's why he was late for his opening time
