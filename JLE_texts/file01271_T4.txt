All right  one day last week, I went camping with my friend And we prepared for the camp and preparing part was really fun We took the tent and we put all the things we needed in a backpack And my friend drove a car And we came to this beautiful mountainside And first of all, we put up our tent And we did some cooking for the dinner And we were planning to eat some curry with rice And everything was going very well until it started to rain  at first maybe we we thought maybe we could manage a little rain But after a while it looked like a storm And not only the rain, but also the wind  began to blow very strong And we couldn't stay there any more Everything was flying all over the place including the curry And so  we decided that we should not stay there any more  we got on the car and  left the place But as it was already in the evening,  we tried to look for the place to stay  so that's when my friend found this small hotel called "Hotel Cosmos" And  we decided to spend the night at this hotel And we got into our room and we took hot shower And we were very relaxed and we had some tea And we could still see the beautiful mountains But it looked like a clod And but it was also very good view to look from to look out from the windows But we were glad that we were not actually in that storm
