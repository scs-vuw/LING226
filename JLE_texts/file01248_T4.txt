One day last week,  a man was driving his car, and at the same time, there's another man who's driving a a moped  this man on the moped was talking to his girlfriend and wasn't really watching the road or being careful 
And when he di when he's while he was driving,  the man in the yellow car or the orange car  hit or kind of crushed into the man in the scooter causing the cell phone that he was usi causing the man on the scooter t to drop his cell phone  after that incident, both men got off the vehicles and started arguing about who had the fault The man on the scooter  insisted that the man in the yellow car had the fault because he wasn't paying attention  when he was driving even though the man on the scooter had just the same amount of fault because he wasn't paying attention to the road either because he was talking on the cell phone And so after a while, a police officer arrived, and they both explained the incident And both men told their stories But  after hearing both men's side of the story, the policeman decided or yeah, decided that the man on the scooter had the fault And that that he had to  get his scooter towed away and probably  get another take another exam for his license because obviously he did he wasn't  worthy of having that license
