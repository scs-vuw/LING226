All right  one day last week, a man went to the train station as usual It's eight o'clock in the morning And the platform was was crowded There there're a lot of people waiting for the train And the man accidentally dropped off his his lug his briefcase  to  to the rail railway because the man standing next to him accidentally elbowed him without looking at him  the man who dropped the briefcase complained to him But while he was talking to the man, the train came and it ran over his briefcase And the man was panicked worrying that his briefcase were was damaged But luckily his briefcase was safe And their train guards fi finally the train guards went down on to the rail train rail, what what what do I wanna say?  the train guards picked up his  briefcase and got it back to him
This was kind of redundant
