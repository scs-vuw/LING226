One day last week, I was walking with my girlfriend It was rainy day it was rainy day And suddenly, I just heard  strange voices voice like the like cat, I think But it was very small voices so my girlfriend didn't recognize it And I just look around it, and found a box And inside the box,  there was a small cat inside And she was so cute And my girlfriend also liked liked the liked the cat liked her And my girlfriend pick up the cat, and asked to me to bring the cat to our house We are living together But I said I can't do that because we are living in the apartment The owner of the apartment will will not allow us to have a pet But she my girlfriend is really wanted to  have a have that cat She was really liked her she couldn't stop to to hope it   I was just thinking, and I just she said she she will take care of that cat all time by herself  I just decided to take the cat to the home, and live together All of  Yeah


boyfriend and girlfriend
Lovers, but not wife and husband Like living before the marriage Very close But not married
 you know, I like the cat very much And   I really want to have a pet, but because I live in the apartment so I I can't take it to the cat I can't take the cat to the home  maybe I will call some call to some friends of mine, and like if they have a space to have a pet And even even even though I couldn't find the friends, I I just need to leave her there, I think
not guilty because I don't have I can't afford to do it I'm not the person who care the cat Maybe she will be not happy when I take it to home
