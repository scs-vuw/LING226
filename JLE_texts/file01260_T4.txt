 One day last week, I was heading to the station to go to work And when I was lining at the platform, waiting for the train, the man next to me bumped to my elbow And I dropped my luggage to on to the railway tracks I told the man that it dropped, but he seemed not help very much, and didn't seem to apologize Then the train came and ran over my luggage But lug luggage was te safe because it was in the middle of the railway tracks Then I called the  station person and he took my luggage off the railway tracks and gave it to me
