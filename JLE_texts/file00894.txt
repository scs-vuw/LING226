 One day last week, I went to a very expensive restaurant with my  senior  He is my boss And  which restaurant is very famou which restaurant is very famous And  usually I can't  go to such kind of restaurant    my boss  invited me  I said I wanted to go  And the restaurant was very expensive, you know, so he didn't  call  only one person to join  And my boss was always  goes to such kind of restaurant  he knows well And  the day last week,  he took some reservation at the restaurant And he said  I could order anything so I or I ordered  many, many things And  I am very usually, I am very poor so I ate a lot And  the dinner was so delicious that I could eat  much  more than usual  And I didn't have to pay at all  I'm very happy  stomach i was full of  delicious meal And my heart is full of something You know you know?
But maybe he was not full of money  because the restaurant was so expensive But he was rich he he is rich  it's 
And  I I'm su I'm sure I worked harder than usual Because when I worked harder, he can  invite me to go to such kind of restaurant, I think  we  said good-bye And I was very happy
