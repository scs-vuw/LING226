 let's say this is Tom Tom is on the way to his office in the morning   it's a usual day, it's like  eight o'clock And but today, he dropped his bag  in the platform
And right  he was so scared and he talk to other people, "What should I do?" And but other people would say, "Oh no idea Why don't you talk to like a station man?" Or they really didn't care about him Oh at that time the train came And oh he was so surprised because his bag is under the train And but after the train passed, his bag was still there  wow look at him He was so,  re released now   now he decided to talk to the man in the station And that man  came down to the platform and picked up his bag and gave it to him  now he's happy and he finally went to his office
