one day last week, I decided to go camping with my very good friend, Aki We packed a lot of stuff, our flush lights,  food to eat, everything, and we even got a tent up We drove to a lake That was about three hours it was about a three-hour drive And we got there We got the tent out We got the fire going And we were about to have our dinner when the storm came The rain started pouring on us and our tent blew away And we weren't we couldn't stay there any longer because the wind was so hard and the rain was coming down really fast as well  we decided to drive and see if we could find a hotel nearby And luckily, we were able to find a hotel called "Cosmos"  we decided to stay there for the night And well even though we wanted to stay by the lake, we were able to see the lake and even the mountains by our through the window in our hotel room And we were able to get a hot cup of tea to warm us up because we were soaked from the w storm
