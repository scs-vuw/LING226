 the boy and girl are were were walking in the street I think rainy day And the boy heard the some sound some voice from somewhere and  maybe she she was asking, "Hey, what's that?"
 after that, they found the small cat maybe small cat in was  were left was left in the small box And maybe this cat small cat was suffering from getting getting wet  the they after they found it,   they come they came to the came up to the cat, so maybe she is offering and, "She is very cute, so that how about having this cat for our home our home?" Oh thank you But she he was refusing Yeah Maybe that " my home is an apartment so that any pet is refused prohibited to to have" But  maybe the she didn't accept what he said    finally finally, he accepted her offer, so that they took the box the cat in and take it cat to the home
