 The last week,
I was walking with my girlfriend And it was rainy And when when  when we when we were going to  my apartment, I heard something and something really cute And I listened carefully And my girlfriend found the box and the box had a cat in it And I said I said we I said I cannot accept and keep my keep  any animals in my apartment But my girl my girlfriend said  "Please I really like I really like cats and please, let's keep this animal this cat together" And  we had some little a little argument, but I really like I really love my girlfriend    whatever she says, I accept
This time also she said she said she wanna wanted to keep cat And I said, "It's  Let's keep this cat" And we jus we just left And we we decided that we were gonna have the cat as a pet
