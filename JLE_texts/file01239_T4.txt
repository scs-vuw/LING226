All right one day last week, two sisters named Julia and Maria decided to go out camping because it was such a nice weather  they packed up their car with all their belongings it's like not all their belongings, but just normal camp things like things for barbecue and a package tent so that they could pop it up Once they arrived at the place, which was, I think, national park, they decided to put up their tent and got their stew ready And did just fine till they felt drops of rain coming down on them And so Julia panicked saying, "Oh my God, there's a storm coming" And she and then the other sister were like, "Oh no, it's all right I think we'll be " until huge cast of rain came It was actually a storm  all their things, the tent's blown away including all the all the barbecue things  they rushed into their car and drove away while lightning is coming down on them And then they just happened to pass by a hotel And they decided, "Well since we can't go camping tonight, why don't we just stay at this hotel since we can't go home" And so they stopped by at the hotel and had a quiet evening unfortunately in a hotel instead of enjoying the great outdoors
