  one day last week,  I have a promise to meet my friend, so I drove a car to go to that place And the man was  driving bi  motor bicycle And he came just in front of me At that time he was calling  by mobile phone And I crashed to him accidentally And his mobile phone was broken down  And  he complained about it  I I must call the policeman to come and explain what happened to him  And  lastly,  yes,  not only mobile phone but also his  motor bicycle has  broken down, so he couldn't drive any more   so he  the driver ? His  motor bicycle was also  taken by   some driver  I must compensate to him later, so I'm very worry about this accident now
