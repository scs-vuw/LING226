Is this me?    One day last week, I was dating with my girl girlfriend  It was raining   When I was  walked down a  street  walked down a road, I found  I heard  some voice of cat  cat   dogs  some  I heard dog's crying  cry crying in a box on the side walk   girlfriend  open found a  child dog in the box And it was it was very very small  It's seem to be  in  infant dog 
 Just  and it looks like   looks like   given away  from given away  from someone
 so she said she wanna  she wanted to bring it back to hi  to her home, and she wanna grow  grow it up and as a pet  First, I thought it's difficult to have pet because  to have a pet because I lived in apartment  so in in a apartment, having pet is pro  prohibited
 But   she wished to have him because the the dog is very pretty very much   the at last, I  admitted her  to her  to have the dog admitted her  to bring a dog to her  to her home
