one day last week, two girls planned to the camping And  they are preparing for the camp and  there are a lot of things for the camp And they put the stuff into the car And  when arrived at the campsite, they started to set up the tent by the lake or river or I don't know And they started to cook something on the ground
And  all of the sudden, it started to rain And and then  the weather changed a lot And  it was extremely windy and the camp stuff  was scattered everywhere and they finally gave up  to stay there And then they got in a car And s in a thunder s storm, they started to go somewhere And on the way to somewhere, they found a motor hotel by the road And they decided to stay there And they ended up in  staying in a hotel room and looking out outside from the room
