      it was   Saturday on last week And  a coup one couple  were walking  together  It was  raining  the it was raining on the day And they they    they having their umbrellas And  walking  together and chatting And when  there are they come to near the  how can I say,  pole, there was a  box And when they are going to pass the box,  the man  can hear  the man he heard something  from the s some  some sound from the box And the man stopped And    carefully opened the box Then,  they found found a  maybe, cat from the box And   the lady wal who who was  walking together with the man,   came to the box and   put up  the cat And she she asked him   she wants to  take the cat,  to her home  but  the  man, maybe her boyfriend,  seems to   not    welcome to  take the cat to  to maybe their home, not her home  but she was, very  good at  negotiating  with  with her boyfriend Finally,   her boyfriend  agreed to  take the cat,  to their home
