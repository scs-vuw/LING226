my name is Mary
And I was last week, I went camping with my friend, Joana
When we got there, we started to make the tent, and we were having a fun time, cooking and everything But as soon as the as soon as we finished building the tent, it started to rain
And it started to storm And the the winds were b blown so fast that we had to pack up immediately And then so so we decided to go stay at a hotel, and we found a hotel called Hotel Cosmos
And by then it was it was it it was lightening everywhere  when when we got there, we were so happy And we and in the end, we stayed in the hotel, and had a nice time, but I wish I could have gone camping
