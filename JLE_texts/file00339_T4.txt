One day last week, a couple was walking in the rain, so they are using umbrellas And, when they went by, electric pole, there was a box And, inside, they hear something are crying And, when a girl opened the box, she found a little kitten and seems like she is willing to take the cat in care But the boy is rejecting her idea, saying, "No, no" But, with girl's requests, and she is hard on accepting the cat, seems the boy's finally agreeing her And, they after, they seems they are more closer than ever with kitten accepted And they are only using one umbrella
