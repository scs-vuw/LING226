you wouldn't think of russell crowe as being the victim of a lot of pranks. he comes across more as the guy who dangles you from a fourth floor balcony by your underwear. but in at least one relationship in his life, crowe was mercilessly pranked over a period of years. and his big, bad tormentor was michael jackson. jackson apparently found out the name that crowe used when he stayed in hotels and would call his room with repartee like, is mr. wall there? is mrs. wall there? are there any walls there? then what's holding the roof up?  in a new interview in the guardian, crowe reveals that the king of pop was unrelenting, quote, "he'd ring me up, and in a strong voice say, there's an emergency, and you need to leave the building. i'd ask who is this? and he'd say, do not worry, russell, just kidding this is michael.  this gets even weirder when you consider that the two men didn't actually know one another. never met him, never shook his hand, said crowe. crowe also complained, you're supposed to grow out of doing that, right? which makes me wonder what part of neverland he doesn't understand.
