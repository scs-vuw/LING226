facing its worst budget shortfall in nearly 100 years, rice university in houston recently made the controversial decision to only fund research projects that involved multiple departments. at first, we were worried we wouldn't find a subject that raised research questions throughout multiple academic disciplines, said ph.d. candidate rick cupfner. but then it came to us: something - or should i say, someone - who mystified literally everyone here at the university and hence, the study of lohanology was born.   what began as a co-project between the women's studies and communications departments to study lindsay lohan has now grown to include the medical school, department of psychology and linguistics department.   we're just trying to understand how she's not in a coma right now, says medical student tran win.   meanwhile, a women's studies undergrad, jessamine bell, has authored a paper she's titled, "seriously, girl: an analysis of lohan, 2006 through 2009." we've got an entire course based just on her twitter feed, says linguistics professor matt spires. she has this fascinating ability to invent new words and re-imagine sentence structure - this, despite showing signs of being functionally illiterate.   spires and his co-authors will present their findings this fall in toronto at omg whatevs.   a conference of leading lohan-ologists from china, the netherlands and argentina.
