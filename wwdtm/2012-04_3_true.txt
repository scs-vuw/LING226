edward williamson spent ten years studying a perplexing problem: why some climbing roses clustered together, killing off surrounding flowers. it was his granddaughter who gave it a name, "the mean girls syndrome."  : in a paper delivered to the british rose enthusiasts biennial conference last month, williamson explained how prettier roses band together, entwining stems and leaves to maximize their attractiveness and exposure to bees. nearby flowers are not only excluded, but the popular clusters actually push other blooms to the side, restricting their sunlight and chances for pollination, creating, yes, wallflowers.  :"it's just like those nasty teenage girls on television," williamson told the conference audience. after experimenting with food, temperature, light and other variables, he said the only effective remedy is to behead the cluster's central rose. "works every time," he said. "the other roses back off quickly after that."
