have you ever stared at a marshmallow and thought this thing is just too white, or this sweet, fluffy thing would be more delicious if it was a selfie? well, you're not alone. in fact you're in royal- adjacent company because james middleton, younger brother of kate middleton, has created a startup that will print your instagrams onto marshmallows.   the college dropout, who learned to bake with his mother as a lad, bakes in a converted barn and sends his treats through the mail to narcissists with a sweet tooth. his marshmallow company is called boomf, which you might think is the sound you make when you see how tremendously hot james middleton is.  but in reality, middleton says the name boomf comes from the noise a marshmallow makes as it falls through your letter box.
