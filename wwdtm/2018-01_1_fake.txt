finding a water main can be tough. and everyone knows you can't do it by just waving a magic wand - except in england, where it turns out that they do exactly that. the story was uncovered when biologist sally le page received a call from her father saying that a man from the water company had just come round with an ultrasonic flow detector, a map of the water network and a divining rod. yes, a divining rod - that y-shaped stick that dates back to the 16th century and allows its users to detect water through the power of magic. intrigued, sally soon found that she could get multiple british water companies to admit that they still use divining rods by employing a devious investigative technique known as asking them.   fully 9 out of 12 water companies confirmed in tweets that they do still use the old methods known as dowsing. when sally pointed out that the use of a stick as a sort of loony, primitive ouija board has been thoroughly discredited by science, one of the companies defiantly defended the practice as, quote, "tried and tested, and we do find them useful."
