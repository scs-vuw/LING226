when grills, the shiny gold and silver platings fitted over teeth, first appeared in the 80s, they were strictly hip hop. flava flav and big daddy kane were among the first wearers. but in marblehead, massachusetts, they're less hip hop than grandpop. at the gracie allen assisted living center, too many residents were wandering off the property. so the allen center installed metal detectors at all the exits and grills in the mouths of all the residents.  quote, "i'm okay with my grandmother looking gangster as long as she's safe," said one concerned relative.  the grills can fit over dentures or replace them altogether. eighty- two-year-old wanda jackson, nicknamed by staff "lil' wanda"...  had her grills inlaid with the pearl earrings her husband gave her fifty years ago.  quote, "i thought they were awfully strange at first, but then i started listening to flo rida and wiz khalifa and now i love my grills. and by the way, happy birthday tupac. keep your head up; i know you're still out there."
