watch for that pothole on route 9 used to be a warning to drivers. these days it's an invitation for visitors to southern vermont to witness a road hazard so infamous it has become a destination all its own. the sleepy little village of west brattleboro, known mostly for its left turn lane, is on the main route to some of vermont's busiest ski resorts. the weekend parades of bmw crossovers and escalades from new york and new jersey have created a pothole of such frame-wrenching, tongue-biting proportions that people are now stopping to have their pictures taken beside it, and not always for insurance purposes.   a shrine of expensive, bent and ruined alloy rims is taking shape on the shoulder, and a volvo wagon with two flat tires and some kind of goo on the dashboard has been abandoned a short distance away. state maintenance crews have either given up on fixing it, or they think it's funny to watch because the famous route 9 pothole only gets bigger and uglier as the weeks go by. this week secretary of the agency of natural resources deb markovitz responded to a petition that the pothole be preserved and turned into a state park by saying simply that might be the stupidest thing to cross my desk all winter, and that's saying something.
