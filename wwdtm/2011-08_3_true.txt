the lithuanian people have had it. they're sick and tired of the outlandish lies they believe americans tell about them. "the american people must understand," says cultural minister jon mokus, "that we're not just a bunch of basketball playing, folk dancing, potato dumpling eating yahoos." and to combat these scurrilous stereotypes, the government of lithuania has completed work on mithuania, a 1,000 acre theme park in central missouri, dedicated to righting wrongs about the baltic country.  : visitors are greeted by giant walk-around puppets, dressed as famous lithuanians like charles bronson and monica lewinsky.  : little kids can try to throw a discus, a popular native sport, through a tire and win a plush jascha heifetz or emanuel conch, both lithuanian descendants.  : rides include a cold beet soup flume ride.  : the most popular attraction at the park? the live show latvia shmatvia, a blistering song and dance takedown of neighboring baltic republic and bitter rival latvia, in which latvians are portrayed, in the words of jon mokus, "as folk dancing, potato dumpling eating yahoos."
