california environmental research firm elliot, martin and zeller have uncovered that the energy americans waste to right inside-out underwear could light a small city. the solution, reversible underpants.   the team's data show that 93 percent of brief, boxers and panties end up reversed in the laundry. turning one garment right side out saps one- tenth of a calorie of expended effort. this calorie is replaced with food, which has to be produced, transported and prepared.   one-tenth calorie doesn't sound like much, but when multiplied by the 600 millions times per laundry week americans alone flip their shorts, it compares to over 300 megawatts of electrical power. the idea behind the reversible underpants, according to dr. zeller is if people did not feel the need to fuss with their fruit of the looms, this vast energy savings would be realized. "this energy cannot be captured," he explains, "it is just never used. we lived in a closed system, so think of it this way, if it helps. every time you put your child's spiderman briefs spidey side out, a light goes out in africa."
