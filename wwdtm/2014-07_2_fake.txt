before justin bieber got that dui in miami, before he egged his neighbor or peed in public or lost his shirt yet again, well, there was that falo of blonde hair which could forgive all the stupid things he's ever done. we speak of course not of the jailed duck bill that biebs' currently sports, but his original bowl haircut and bangs which doctors say have the power to prevent skin cancer.   in an editorial in the july issue of the journal of the american association pediatrics, crystal agi and bernard cohen argue that boys who wear biebs' bangs develop fewer freckles or skin cancer. quote, "for the past few years, we have embraced his character style in our teenage patient population to encourage discussion of sun protective measures," they write. my favorite part - the doctors have named their medical brainchild the new big bang theory.
