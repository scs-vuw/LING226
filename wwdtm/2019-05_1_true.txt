the sydney opera house is a cultural landmark and source of national pride for australians. but this week, the staff there discovered a shocking fact. opera might be destroying the opera house. the current production at the theater's a new work by the australian composer oliver bailey  called "outback." it's billed as "oklahoma" meets "lion king," set in the australian outback.   the first act closing number is meant to duplicate the sound of a kangaroo stampede and is sung by a 100-member chorus of all bass parts, the lowest notes that men can sing. as the song begins, its mezzo forte and allegro - not vivace, mind you, but pretty allegro.   then the accelerando and crescendo kick in, and it is definitely vivace,and also pretty freaking forte.   then there's another shift, and we are all the way to presto and fortissimo, thank you very much.   but by the end, it is full on prestississimo  and fortississimo. so you know, it's fast and loud.   during the performance tuesday night, the stage began to sink, and several performers lost their balance and toppled over, adding an unintended touch of physical comedy to a dramatic kangaroo slaughter.   at intermission, engineers examined the stage and discovered cracks in the foundation. just as soprano notes can shatter glass, it turns out all that bass was literally shaking the foundation. opera house officials are raising money for repairs, and bailey is being asked to rewrite the opera to be less destructive. the hundred-kangaroo stampede will now be a 10-koala stroll.   and the bass parts will shift to the slightly higher baritone register.  the notes are so high, i feel like a castrati, said renowned italian basso giacomo aprile .  also, what the heck is this show about anyway?
