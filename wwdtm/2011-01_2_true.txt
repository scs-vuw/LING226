the law firm of ward, oxendale, fowler and wilkinson in atlanta has perfected a system by which it's been able to lay off 50 percent of its junior associates: the drive-thru affidavit. clients drive up to the firm's offices, which are located in an abandoned jack in the box franchise. using the old drive-thru system and speaking into the clown's mouth, clients are sworn in on a virtual bible. they give testimony into a video camera and a microphone. and then, having it run through voice recognition software and notarized, the client having long since driven away. "it's quick, it's clean, and as far as we can tell, it's even constitutional," said lynn oxendale. "we're hoping to save enough money here to improve the physical plant and perhaps get rid of the clown."
