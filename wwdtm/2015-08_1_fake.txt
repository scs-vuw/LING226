if you'd like to have gorgeous gams like tippi hedren, there's a workout for you. it's "the birds" in real life, except more fun and less murdery. it's huge in the uk. they call it gull running, and here's how it works. you go to a boardwalk in a seaside village like brighton or blackpool, you buy your chips with salt and vinegar, then you pull up your hoodie hood, extend the arm holding the greasy gulll bait overhead and run your arse off. inevitably, before you can explain to the seagulls that chips are not really chips, but actually french fries, you are attacked by nasty, horrifying, feathery freaks. whoever sprints the furthest without having his cornish pasty nicked and his eyes pecked into bloody wells wins, even if he's covered in globs of white poop. the motto of the gull runners who taunt the bloodthirsty birds? keep calm and carry on.
