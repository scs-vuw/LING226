when opera director francesco mariangela  moved from verona, italy, to oklahoma city to revive the failing oklahoma city opera house , he had no idea that the man who would help him save this historical landmark would be a local baseball umpire named john hurley thompson . one day, when mariangela went to watch his 9-year-old son play baseball, he discovered thompson and knew that this american was a natural-born opera singer. mariangela states,  i go to my son baseball game.    first of all, i'm not so much understanding the baseball.    why you no kicking the ball?    why are you hitting it with a fat stick?    but the umpire, i hear him say, you're out.    and i think to myself, this guy got the voice of an angel.   so mariangela approached thompson and convinced him to go in for an audition. not only did thompson nail the audition, but he got the lead in the local production of puccini's "la boheme." thompson, whose only experience singing before had been in the shower, states, it's all kind of a crazy dream; i never thought i would be an opera singer; i don't even speak italian; truth be told, i have no idea what i'm saying up there.   but the crowd seems to love it. and the crowds keep coming. the opera house has been sold out for six weeks straight as fans come from all over the region to experience this new local star. some have even compared thompson to luciano pavarotti, nicknaming the little league umpire umpirerotti . mariangela, who looks great for having discovered this talent, states,  sometimes you just find a gem when you least expect it; speaking of gems, why you call it a baseball diamond?    it's just four bases of equal distance. that makes it a square.
