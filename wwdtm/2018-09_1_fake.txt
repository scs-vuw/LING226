in the united kingdom, an evil paraglider is menacing the fine citizens of bexhill-on-sea, a town known for putting its major feature in the name of its town. bexhill-on-sea is meant to be very charming, but this paraglider's been flying in the face of that charm. he likes to glide low enough so that he can hurl insults at passers-by on the beach below.   he's called a local fisherman, a minger - whatever that means - and probably said to one woman, the cellulite on your thighs looks like an english muffin, which we just call a muffin because we're in england.   and he almost certainly said to a group of tourists, i wish you would brexit from this town.   an investigation was launched two years ago to find the rogue paraglider and bring him to justice. but so far, the police have failed to do so, despite the fact that the airborne wanker paraglides, like, every day and that paragliding is pretty bloody slow, so it's not like they wouldn't be able to out-jog him during flight, and despite the fact that they even partnered with the civil aviation authority, so there's literally two teams of officials hunting down this one aggressive paraglider. so despite all of the odds being in their favor, the two-year long investigation continues.
