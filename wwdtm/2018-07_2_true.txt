both god and the devil, they say, are in the details, especially when it comes to the world of the scam artist. so when colombian-born swindler anthony gignac decided to start hoodwinking wealthy corporations and individuals by posing as saudi crown prince khalid bin al-saud, he made sure he was pretty thorough. federal investigators say that 47-year-old gignac was able to bilk investors out of more than $8 million between 2015 and 2017 by paying attention to little details like faking diplomatic license plates and making sure his credit card said things like, his royal highness, prince and sultan. but it seems the ersatz emir had a brain fart of royal proportions when it came to duping what would prove to be his final would-be victim, jeffrey soffer. according to a federal indictment, soffer, quote, "became increasingly wary of gignac when the fake sheik, quote, "happily wolfed down bacon and pork products during meals."   according to a former fbi agent who participated in the bureau's celebrated abscam sting operation in the late '70s, quote, "rule no. 1 in pretending to be phony royalty from an islamic country - you always decline the swine."
