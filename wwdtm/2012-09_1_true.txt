tourists are slowing down these days as they drive down the streets of rural bayfield county in northern wisconsin. the local taxidermy firm of wilcox and statman has created a sensation with its latest innovation: road kill lawn ornaments.  :"we were driving along one day," said bud wilcox, "when we noticed that the county hadn't been picking up the carcasses the way it used to." the local county commission admits this, but pleads budgetary priorities in its own defense. so wilcox and his partner sam statman enlisted the aid of statman's nephew paul, a sculptor and recent graduate of the wisconsin college of art, to create decorations out of the deceased fauna. soon, the lawns of bayfield county were replete with the lovely lifelike statues of deer and elk. some of these were decorated with lights for last year's christmas rush.  : but the real craze began when the taxidermists began cutting and pasting parts of different animals together.  : soon, a dozen houses became roadside attractions, featuring woodchucks with antlers, porcupines with the heads of squirrels, and most memorably, a chipmunk head atop a black bear.  :"i've met so many wonderful people since i put that up," said connie fitzgerald, owner what she calls the bearmunk.  :"one couple has been back twice to take pictures with their grandchildren." wilcox and statman are now making plans to leave the boondocks of dr. moreau and take their business national.
