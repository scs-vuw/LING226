the nutritious massage in ojai, california provides a massage that is also delicious. the client lies on a table while a fruit smoothie is skillfully prepared on top of them. "it sounds crazy, i know," says founder janet pilham, "but when you think about it, what better tool than a potato masher to ease tight muscles?" with the use of a mallet, rolling pin, wire whisk, ladle and even some unexpected kitchen utensils, the massage therapist, working the speed and precision of a sushi chef, crushes, squeezes and chops a combination of fruits selected from a menu, by the client, directly on their bare skin.  "i'm hooked," claims regular client mary carter. "i can never decided if i should get the fruit i'd love to drink in the smoothie, or the fruit that feels good. the blueberries sometimes almost kind of pop and then the pressure is like a jolt. i don't really like to drink watermelon juice, but when she rolls it on my back, it's good deep tissue."
