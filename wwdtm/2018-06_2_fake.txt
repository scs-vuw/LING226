baskin-robbins is trying something new. to be the face of their true taste of summer campaign, they've hired a man so profoundly lactose intolerant that eating their product sends him to the bathroom for an hour each time.   stephen kelsey, also known as cheese daddy on twitter...  ...was recruited after employees at his local baskin-robbins branch noticed the 39-year-old came to the shop five times a week, every week, and left clutching his stomach each time. kelsey is severely lactose intolerant and has been all his life. growing up, all the kids enjoyed ice cream, he said, and i always felt like i was missing out. when asked about the motivation for this campaign, specifically pointing to the brand's existing dairy-free options, a baskin-robbins spokesperson said, for 80 years, we have been the taste of summer, and we want people to experience that original taste, whether or not their bodies can break down complex proteins.   for cheese daddy, it's about feeling the fear and doing it anyway. hopefully, i'm showing other lactose-intolerant people that they, too, can live without boundaries, he said. they just have to embrace the cramps.
