jordan abreu really loves his girlfriend, charlotte. charlotte really loves her dog, devil. so jordan decided to use her dog in his foolproof plan to get charlotte to marry him. except, it turns out, the devil's in the details. jordan and charlotte met as undergrads at duke university. therefore, obviously, the most romantic proposal jordan could imagine was to kidnap her dog and send charlotte anonymous messages telling her that if she wanted to see her little dog alive she had to show up on the field at the duke blue devils football game at halftime. i thought it would be really funny because she hates sports, jordan said - and also really cool to cut out individual letters and glue them into a retro ransom note. he made sure that stadium officials met the distraught charlotte to escort her onto the field so the jumbotron could catch all the action. when charlotte saw jordan at midfield on bended knee holding her beloved shih tzu, she burst into tears. when she noticed that jordan had thoughtfully died her devil dog blue and strung a diamond ring around his collar, her heart started pounding - like really pounding - like with the kind of hyperventilation that comes from a panic attack. she grabbed her dog, kicked jordan in his blue devils and ran off the field.
