steve mandel is a soft-spoken literary agent who keeps his voice low and his ford taurus in the garage. but over the past 10 years. mandel's clients have increasingly pressured him to act outrageous and offensive, like the fictional hollywood super-agent, ari gold, in "entourage." mandel started losing clients as they jumped ship and joined other, more aggressive agencies because he wasn't "entourage-y" enough. so last summer, he spent $10,000 to attend entourage-estan, a weeklong "entourage" boot camp for agents. campers took seminars called things like, the f bomb and how to throw it and verbal abuse: it's not just for underlings. "entourage" basically ruined my business, but now i'm fighting back ari gold style.
