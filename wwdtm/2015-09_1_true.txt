melanie kahn  and bo ford  have built their yoga studio business over many years of thoughtful instruction and clean floors. but there is one problem they have never been able to crack - getting more men into the studio and onto the mats. we see about three guys for every 10 women and two of them just came to meet the women, said ford. some guys get talked into it by their wives and girlfriends, show up once and never come back. ford and kahn's breakthrough idea came when one of these guys complained, nobody wins at this game, what's the point of it? say hello to boga , competitive yoga for men who don't do yoga. not to be confused with broga , which is yoga for annoying men who do do yoga.   unlike yoga yoga, which is done on sticky mats, boga yoga is done on slippery mats that are soaped down before every session. contestants are required to hold standard yoga poses, such as downward dog and tree, without falling down until the whistle is blown. there are three rounds, with the final round being a last man standing bent over on one foot closer. extra points may be awarded for endurance, sounding most like a buffalo and deepest plumbers crack.   winners get a boga beer mug filled with ibuprofen. three weeks in and the classes are all full, reported mrs. khan. men are idiots.
