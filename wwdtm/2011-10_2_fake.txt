ian neale's giant rutabaga seems to have struck a chord in many. just days after he posted pictures of it online, people began showing up on his farm to see the amazing root vegetable for themselves. "naturally, i let them come by for a rutabaga visit," says mr. neale. "but one day, i look out and see some young folks bowing down to the thing. they appeared to be worshipping it." within a few weeks, a bewildered neale had crowds of rutabaga worshipers on his farm. valkiere page visits the rutabaga once a week. "i don't know that i'd call it worshipping," she says, "i just confess my sins to it and ask it for help."  : "it doesn't judge me."  : "it just feels good to be with the rutabaga. it has changed my life. i will never eat another vegetable."  : "i already don't eat meat. honestly, i'm hungry," says jason debride.  : shifting a small pebble from one side of his mouth to the other.  : "i'm here to ask the rutabaga for help." those visiting the rutabaga seem to leave serene and satisfied. diana perry walks happily towards me, explaining, "look here, i've been visiting the rutabaga for only two weeks, and i used to walk kind of funky, you see, with my foot turned out like that. now, i walk like this. it's all the rutabaga." "it's the hard times," claims neale. "people are going around the bend. it's got to be. i raised an enormous cucumber two years and no one so much as dropped by to say hello to it."
