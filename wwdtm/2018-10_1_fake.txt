mark shurtleff  and gillian canavan  were returning home to their brooklyn brownstone from a lovely honeymoon in the bahamas when their worst fears were realized. their home security alarm was blasting. and police officers were standing in front of their building. one officer on the scene told them, i've never seen anything like this. but upon further investigation, it wasn't a robbery at all. sometime over the weekend, mark's dog tom  escaped from a neighbor who was watching him and returned home through the doggy door, setting off the alarm's motion sensors. but tom wasn't alone. he brought the neighbor's dog and cat, along with three other dogs.   the place was left in shambles - muddy paw prints, shredded sofa cushions. and animal waste was everywhere. most shockingly, a wine bottle had been knocked over. and the animals licked its contents clean off the floor.   this would explain the cat passed out in its own vomit on the stairs.   and there was also no water left in any of the toilet bowls.   clearly, a desperate attempt to get sober.   when police initially entered, tom was in the living room, having relations with the neighbor's dog...   ...in what officer toby crittenden  described as, quote, "in a style that doggies are accustomed to."   mark suspects tom was heartbroken over the marriage of his longtime owner and perhaps wanted to, quote, "go on a bender." both owner and dog are now in pet therapy, a booming industry in their neighborhood of park slope, brooklyn.
