have a pothole problem? not in the small english town of bury, where a local artist has come up with an arousing way to get the road hazards repaired. he paints giant  penises around them. the potholes will be there for months. the anonymous street artist told newsbeat, quote, "suddenly you see something amusing around it. everybody sees it, and either it gets reported or fixed."  the city council is not amused, calling the large white outlines, quote, "obscene," quote, "stupid and insulting." the artist, who the press have nicknamed wanksy...   is unrepentant and says his drawings are artistic expression. quote, "to be offended by that, you must be very prudish." and since you asked, the street penises last about four hours - kidding, actually about a week or two, which is making the asphalt layers very jealous.
