for years, the town of funk springs, arkansas tried to distance itself from its evocative name without much success. so finally in 2008, it decided to embrace the name and make some money off of it, and thus was born the first ever funk springs funktacular. a celebration of all things pungent.  there's the livestock tent, which is honestly just mostly skunks. there's also the dunk tank filled with spoiled buttermilk. but the real highlight of the weekend has become the competitive body odor contest, which pits four men against each other in a contest to see who's b.o. is the most intense. last year's winner, rudy thompson, as crossfit instructor by day, estimates he worked out 90 times without showering in preparation. but that wasn't all, i was taking a performing enhancer, he admitted to the funk springs leader - raw onions. six or eight of them a day. thompson who lives alone...   ...says it was all worth it to win first prize - a $400 gift certificate to don's unfinished furniture emporium. the stakes were even higher, it could be argued, for last year's loser chuck abernathy, who according to the rules, will be forced to judge next summer's competition.
