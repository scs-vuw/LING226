ok, 50-year-old sally meriwether of benson, idaho has always loved to bake for family, but she found herself facing more heat than usual this week after a controversial entry in a bake-off. the wholesome wife and mother of two was excited when she learned about a betty crocker sponsored baking contest for the first prize of $10,000. her family desperately needed a new car and the prize would cover the station wagon they'd had their eye on. sally was usually confident in her chocolate chip brownies, which were famous in her small town, but started to worry when she learned how many people from across the state would be competing. she really needed that car, so she started experimenting with her recipe to make her brownies the undeniable favorites. well, it worked. after serving the four judges a large helping of her super sweet and salty brownies, they each started circling back for seconds, thirds and then, even fourths. twenty minutes later, the lead judge announced that sally was the winner of the first-place cash prize, but other contestants got suspicious when he went on to say that sally was also being nominated for best rainbow unicorn. : that's when they noticed the other judges lying on the floor giggling in front of sally's station and one judge trying to order a pizza delivery into a paper cup. yes it turns out sally's secret ingredient was pot and she'd whipped up a batch of extra delicious pot brownies using weed she'd bought from her son's gym teacher. the cops were called and sally was arrested and disqualified from the competition. there is a happy ending this story however - a marijuana dispensary in colorado heard about the contest and ordered millions of her brownies. sally now drives an audi convertible.
