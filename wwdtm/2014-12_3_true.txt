at 355 pounds, william howard taft was our heaviest president. he did not, as lead has it, get stuck in a tub. he got stuck in the doors of a pennsylvania avenue trolley car for two hours, during which time a scamp snipped off his coattails and a street urchin even stole one of his spats. anyway, he did not get stuck in a tub because he had a tub that was built for four. now that's a white house scandal waiting to open. the extra tubby size tub now sits in taft's boyhood home in the mount auburn section of cincinnati. to bring more visitors to the home, local station 9107 is sponsoring a very special giveaway. a free bath for four in the taft tub. the filthiest family in cincinnati contest has already drawn 93 of the queen city's most unclean foursomes. as 91.7 host andy travis puts it, the family that destains together remains together.
