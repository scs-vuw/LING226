strap hangers of the world know the pains of public transportation, particularly in summertime when it is quite literally the pits. across the globe, commuters are crushed into densely packed compartments face-to-face with a stranger's underarm that's been insufficiently perfumed.   now a tacoma-based consulting firm think they've solved the issue and are currently conducting tests on the subway network in seoul, south korea. it's a very simple concept, explains lead engineer sarah chen . no one wants to cause a scene by calling someone out for their scent, so our solution is both effective and, more importantly, anonymous. each strap and handle on a train car is equipped with a special mechanism which, when activated by a subtle twist and pull motion, dispenses a pleasant fragrant mist which deodorizes the area immediately around the olfactorily affected passenger.   while attempts have been made to alleviate train stench in the past, this is the first to be passenger-operated. our original design had the spray aimed directly at the problem area, explained chen.   but height differences meant some people were getting deodorized right in the face.   the pilot program is going well. we're calling it axilla, says chen - partially because that's the scientific name for armpits but mainly because axilla sounds like a giant lizard made of body spray.
