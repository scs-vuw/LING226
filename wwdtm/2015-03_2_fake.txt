written language was invented a little over 5,000 years ago, and only a millennium later, language found its true purpose - customer complaints. that's when a mesopotamian guy named ea- nasir sold the messenger of a guy named nanni  a bad batch of copper ingots. nanni fired off a clay tablet that read in part, what do you take me for that you treat somebody like me with such contempt? he asked for his money back. no word on what ea-nasir's response was, but nanni's clay tablet, unlike your one star yelp review, made it into a museum.
