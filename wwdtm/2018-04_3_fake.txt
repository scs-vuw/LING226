some of us are old enough to remember riff trucks  delivering books and climbing uphill to spread the message that, indeed, reading is fundamental. well, in canada, literacy has never been cooler. in fact, an indie rock band has been rediscovered by a whole new generation after appearing in a literacy test. this year's ontario secondary school literacy test featured a 2013 article about the ottawa-based pop band brothers dube. the band members, who are brothers, had opened for the beach boys not long after losing their mother to cancer. the brothers used the appearance to raise money for research - an inspiring story that sent test takers to the web, where they discovered that in the last couple years, the group has transformed itself into a stoner band.   today, they're simply known as dube because, well...  ...dube. education officials were none too pleased, but the band members are thrilled by their new popularity. said brother jig dube, we got so many comments from people saying, wow, you were the best part of the test; i'm pretty sure i passed because of you guys. but don't expect band members to be touring in riff trucks - spliff trucks , maybe.
