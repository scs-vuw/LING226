if you go to a library right near toronto, you may read of the lone ranger and of tonto. but the librarian may have to make you stop, if you try to open "hop on pop." see, one weird patron round that hood, thinks "hop on pop" is quite un-good. the reason for such fusses and bothers, why the book promotes violence on fathers.  damages were sought, apologies demanded. dr. seuss and the staff were reprimanded. so much clattering and fuss was had to save the health of dear old dad. but our brave librarians then thought better and tossed the letter in the shredder.
