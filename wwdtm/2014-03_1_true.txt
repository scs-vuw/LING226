centuries ago, sensation seekers in london would drop in on bedlam, the hospital where insane people were locked up, to watch the lunatics howl and bang their heads against the bars. i don't know of any tourist destination quite like that today, but if that sort of thing interests you, check out manhattan night court in downtown new york city.  every night there, about 70 folks who have just been nabbed for various offenses are arraigned. some are granted bail; others denied it. and more and more spectators, reported the associated press this week, are coming to see the show. night court, unlike the empire state building or glimpses of donald trump, is, quote, something that feels really underground and unique, says regis st. louis, the incongruously named author of lonely planet new york. this week a visitor from ranfurly, new zealand, was surprised to see that she was sitting near people in handcuffs. now it might take handcuffs to you or me to sit through most broadway shows today, but this was downtown. these people were waiting to learn whether they would spend a head-banging night in jail.
