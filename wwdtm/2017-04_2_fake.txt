uber driver corone walsh  picked up his fare, farhat facrildine , in downtown hillsboro, n.h., five minutes after he got the request. off they headed to an address somewhere in the white mountains. unfortunately, as the night began to fall and the car sped along a windy part of the road framed by a precipice, corone walsh accidentally dropped his phone out of the window. he slammed on the brakes instinctively, not realizing that his passenger, mr. facrildine, held his own phone out the window while taking a picture. and that phone, too, skittered irretrievably down the ravine. now neither man knew where they were.   they could not call for help. they drove around until they had only teaspoons in the gas tank. they parked and couldn't even put on a radio station while they waited for help. neither one knew what music they liked, as spotify usually chose it for them.   they couldn't make eye contact. i think we were scared and unhappy, says corone walsh, which he discovered through a trauma counseling after their rescue. but without emojis, we had no way to express it.
