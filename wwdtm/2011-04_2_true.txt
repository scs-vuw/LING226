last november, when all of england was going barking mad over the royal engagement, the royal humane society decided to capitalize on the craze for all things royal by creating an ad campaign showing the queen with her herd of corgies and the slogan, "corgies, they're royally cool." the shelter was hoping to promote all dog adoptions, but it turns out the people only wanted corgies. and so the shelter disguised 200 puppies.  pugs, mastiffs and border collies, ad corgies. dying their fur blonde, and in one case installing prosthetic ears under the head of a very angry chihuahua.  the problem is that all puppies grow, and these puppies grew up not to be corgies. when one horrified owner realized his little royal puppy was actually 180-pound new finland, he dropped off the dog at the gates of buckingham palace, along with its adoption papers. other disgruntled dog owners followed suit, and the pack of unruly dogs grew. dudley ladu, palace spokesman said, "the queen is not amused."
