the 2018 grand slam of darts was not without controversy this year. for the first time in its storied history, the games were the focus of animal rights protesters who are contending that the dart association is promoting animal cruelty by continuing to use the term bullseye.   a crowd of protesters heckled attendees as they entered the building holding up signs that read, stick a dart in your own eye...   ...what did the bull do to you and trump sucks.   a spokesman for safe, the save animals from exploitation, organization said it's time for the dart community to stop using the defenseless bull as its play thing. we went for the fox hunters. we're eliminating the bullseye. and we're coming after the flea circus next.   jonathan haskel  the head of the national dart guard association seemed genuinely perplexed by the protests. we've had complaints before but mainly about our drinking and our hygiene. this is a new one to me.
