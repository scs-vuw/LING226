when a gorilla at the tallinn zoo in estonia died earlier this summer, the zoo didn't just lose a beloved primate. they lost their mascot. for almost two decades, lyudia  was the 6-foot star of the rundown zoo, attracting thousands of visitors. she could sign hundreds of words and loved to catch bananas from the kids who'd wave at her. she could even break dance. so when she dearly departed, management feared the zoo would also die from lack of attendance. there was only one thing to do - keep lyudia's demise a secret and stuff zookeeper merick cep  into a gorilla suit.   cep threw himself into his role wholeheartedly. from opening to closing time for the past month, he played lyudia, even going so far as to pretend to pick nits out of the hair of his colleagues who came to feed him - or her. but the jig was up when 6-year-old andras pavlov  attended the zoo with his camp last week and threw a banana to the ape man he thought was lyudia. the gorilla moonwalked away from it. another kid threw her banana. they all had bananas in their lunch that day. and soon the gorilla was scampering all over the cage wildly dodging bananas until, little andras says, the gorilla kept showing us her middle finger.   i didn't know what that meant, so i did it back to her. and then my teacher started yelling at me. the next thing i saw was lyudia taking off her head. and we all started screaming.   turns out that the, quote, unquote, "gorilla" was allergic to bananas. cep was treated by zoo doctors in the cage for anaphylactic shock. the children were treated for emotional shock.
