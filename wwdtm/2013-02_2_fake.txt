every year, the american psychological association releases a new edition of its journal on psychological disorders. and this year, they've made an addition. their journal now includes something called acute over-sharing disorder, also known as kardashian disease.  according to the journal, this disorder affects 2.3 million americans every year. doctors and psychiatrists blame smart phones and everything on the internet. symptoms of aod include using idiotic acronyms like lol or rolfl instead of actual laughter, thinking it's ok to describe your baby's bowel movements in graphic detail during important business meetings, taking pictures of your food and showing it to your date who is sitting across from you in the restaurant.  one aod patient told reporters, "when my doctor told me i had something called kardashian disease, i naturally assumed it was an std."  "i was so relieved to hear i just had a crippling psychological disorder."
