to avoid losing their librarians during these difficult economic times and budget cuts, in homestead, pennsylvania, library lovers have provided free room and board to their beloved librarians. the campaign - titled, save a librarian, we saved whales, we can do this - has so far been quite a hit, says librarian host chris mccraw. we were nervous at first to save a librarian. we werent sure what they would eat. i mean, they're so well-informed. if you're-well informed, there's nothing you can eat, really. and we were a bit ashamed that our books weren't well-organized. no, they were, honey, interrupts his wife, renee, they just werent alphabetized. i did them by size. the librarian we kept was wonderful, crows librarian host susan swamu. a bit messy in the kitchen, but reading time was awesome. she had my preschooler reading well beyond her age level. within weeks, she went from "hop on pop" to "portnoy's complaint."
