estelle schmidt  of hagelsdorf, luxembourg, always feared flying. nothing could get her on a plane except her love for her great-grandfather, marcel muller . when marcel died, all of hagelsdorf mourned him because, for as long as anyone could remember, he had provided the village's most pungent pickles. on his deathbed, he summoned 24-year-old estelle and asked her to fly to gibraltar to scatter his ashes. then he bequeathed her his most beloved pickle. according to legend, this pickle marinates in a brine made with water in which jesus washed his feet.   since marcel's death, estelle has carried this pickle constantly. she strokes it by day and returns it to its cloudy water by night to re-brine. she knew...   ...that the only way she could fly to gibraltar was if she were clutching marcel's pickle in her lap. but passengers on the small plane rioted over its noxious smell, so the luxair flight attendant wrenched the green stink bomb from estelle's hands and put it in the aircraft's mini fridge. even after being reunited with the pickle upon landing, estelle sued the airline for mental anguish. this week, the european court of justice heard the case. after witnessing estelle's attachment to what one justice called the holy cucumber, the five judges ruled unanimously in her favor, legally naming it an emotional support pickle.   estelle funneled her grateful tears into the jar of juice declaring, i honor this cornichon with the salt of my joy.
