there's a new way to get to work in new york, and it is taking the city by the walls. it's a new startup called prkr - that's parkour with no vowels.    parkour, of course, is the new sport of leaping from place to place in the urban environment like acrobatics without a circus tent or a net underneath you. prkr provides you with your very own parkour coach, who will show up at your home at a designated time and help you jump, spin, climb and somersault your way to work. it's backed entirely by out-of-work former circus performers.    because is there any other kind of former circus performers?    owner bigsby daniels  says, quote, "people complain that the sidewalks in midtown are too crowded, and they are. but the walls are like an express lane."    all of a sudden, my boring commute was an exciting life-and-death adventure, said prkr client leslie danson  from her hospital bed.    as soon as my clavicle heals, i'm going to upgrade to the spider-man rooftop jumps package.
