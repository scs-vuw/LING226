if you're an aspiring scientist with a lively mind and no particular need to be popular with fellow primates, you might just have a future in the burgeoning field of monkey annoyance.   yes, in the current issue of primate research, dr. kenji onishi finds that one of the best ways to annoy a japanese macaque is with flying squirrels. apparently, flying squirrels are loathed by macaques as much as they are by, say, russian agents.   dr. onishi, who specializes in primate peevery, worked long hours to find that those squirrels are the monkey equivalent of, say, rush-hour traffic or tv networks that air commercials at 20 times the volume of the actual show.   it's possible that some of this over-the-top tree rage might be the male macaques showing off, says dr. onishi. but that question, apparently, is why we need to keep annoying monkeys. next up, dr. onishi will study the eating habits of baboons and how it is affected by telemarketing.
