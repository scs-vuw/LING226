if you're getting married and you want one last night out with the lads, who's your inspiration? why not the most famous bachelor in the world, a man who's loved by millions of ladies, who lives in a palace, a guy who wears chunky jewelry and dresses like a boss? that's right, the dude you want to emulate for your bachelor party is the pope. and the vehicle you need is the popemobile. for just 300 euro an hour, you and your buddies can be driven around in a real popemobile from 1979. you have to party near dublin, though, because this hot ride is property of the dublin wax museum and was purchased by a local businessman named paddy dunning. the popemobile was built for pope john paul ii's first visit to ireland. and paddy gave the popemobile a $77,000 makeover. while pimping it out for stag parties, he parked it at his mom's house and invited some nuns to come visit. talk about indulgences. this ride offers 15 seats, including a papal throne that you can sit on or use to hold your keg. if that's not enough to make you gentlemen genuflect, check out the popemobile's rooftop viewing balcony. what better way to celebrate the sacrament of holy matrimony than standing where the supreme pontiff once gave papal blessings and drunkenly singing "i still haven't found what i'm looking for" at the top of your lungs?
