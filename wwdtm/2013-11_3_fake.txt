luxembourg's air force has not seen combat since its 1824 border war with moldavia, which is why the force itself is virtually unchanged. it's still europe's only all-hot-air-balloon air force.  colorful, yes, but very expensive to maintain. it's also very expensive to deliver pizza in luxembourg, a country almost entirely populated by castles atop hills. quote, the distances are so far it simply makes no sense to spend so much in petrol for the delivery of one lousy pie, says luxembourg papa john's branch manager rolph gruber.  if only we had a mode of pizza delivery with a less expensive fuel sources, which is why the luxembourg air force is now sponsored by papa john's. pizzas are now delivered by luxembourg military, and they stay hot. quote, it's so nice to receive my pizza up in my turret and not have to lower my drawbridge, says customer baroness else schrader.  and so i say to my fellow luxembourgians, support our troops and call papa john's today.
