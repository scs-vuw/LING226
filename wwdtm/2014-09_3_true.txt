lamotrigine is a highly useful drug that can effectively be used to control epileptic seizures. side effects can include rashes, fever, fatigue and compulsive versifying. that's right, according to a new study in a journal neurocase, patients treated for right temporal lobe seizures often emerge, quote, "producing multiple rhyming poems" presumably starting with i need some rest, i need some leisure because that was just one hell of a seizure.  this form of hypergraphia apparently can't be resisted. one patient, a 76-year-old woman with no previous medical history of poeticizing suddenly found herself seizure free, but producing 10 to 15 poems a day on subjects such as housework, shopping and how deeply annoying it is to be unable to stop writing poems. my seizures verily did vamoose, but left me a cut rate dr. seuss. tempted am i to writhe and twitch because epilepsy is bad, but poetry's a bitch.
