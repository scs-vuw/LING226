ok, so there's this great person - richard nixon.  you don't love nixon? don't love nixon? i guess you - you aren't political humorists.  i love nixon. watergate - the best two years of my life. i mean, it was wonderful. when have we had so much fun with american politics, you know? got to love richard nixon. but he also created the rumba. not the roomba, but the rumba - the dance. or at least he inspired it. in the spring of 1958, then vice president richard nixon went on a goodwill tour of latin america. and found darn little good will toward him or the usa. in fact, he was attacked by rioting crowds everywhere he went. in rio de janeiro, he was nearly killed when protesters tried to flip his car. and brazilian bandleader elajo baricon  was there that day. and the repeated chants of the protesters - the staccato of fists pounding on the fenders of nixon's cadillac and the rhythmic push, push of hundreds of people trying to overturn that car - this gave baricon  an idea for a whole new beat in latin music - the modern rumba. huge, popular hit, and the singers in baricon's  band showed audiences the dance steps. and in brazil, the music is still sometimes called the ricaro trucaro  - tricky dick.
