sometimes those who can't do really do teach. the worst swim instructor in philadelphia can't swim. ludwig jones got a job as a child swim instructor at rolling acres, a small country club. the problem is ludwig can't swim. the man is 6'7" tall and would walk on the bottom of the pool while faking the arm strokes of a swimmer.  he was found out when he almost drowned after accidentally walking into the deep end of the pool.  the lifeguards thought he was clowning around, since they knew ludwig was a swim instructor, but when his screams move from yelling for a friend to screams of panic, they knew something was wrong. it was an easy rescue, said lifeguard jim wilson. the hardest part was for us to stop laughing while pulling him out of the pool.  now how does this happen, one might ask, a swim instructor who can't swim. we asked ludwig's supervisor arthur aimes. well, said mr. aimes, ludwig was really popular with the kids. he was here every day helping the kids swim. and they loved him. so we bypassed the normal swim test and just hired him.  when word got out ludwig couldn't swim, mr. aimes himself got written up along with ludwig. now unable to fire ludwig due to his seniority, the only thing mr. aimes can do is give ludwig scores of one across the board on his annual review and assign ludwig duties like blowing up pool inflatables and cleaning the kiddie pool every night.
