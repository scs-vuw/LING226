in the tiny town of linthicum , local police are investigating a mysterious case involving the chattels of local sheep farmer percy blazeby . on the morning of march 4, blazeby went outside shortly after dawn to find every last sheep in his flock of 30 dressed as lords and ladies in elizabethan-era period costumes.   i was well shocked, says blazeby. the wigs and hats were easy enough to pluck off. but it took me most of the day to wrestle them out of their corsets.   according to somerset county pc james adams, this is a rather unusual case. i've not seen one like this before.   no suspects have yet been identified. despite his initial alarm, mr. blazeby did maintain a sense of humor over the incident, saying, my flock looked like they could, any minute, break into a right proper production of "as you like it."   get it? ewe - forget it.
