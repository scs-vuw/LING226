everyone at the international darts championship was impressed by one of the first american women to make it to the finals - dr. sheree gurtson  an agricultural chemist professor from the university of nebraska who was competing while wearing a classic cornhuskers farmer's overall and plaid shirt with farm girl pigtails. the british tabloids called her dr. pippy  long darts.   the semi-final round started like any other. dr. gurtson and her challenger charles cook  walked out and shook hands. by the second round, charles cook was visibly sweating and also whispering to each dart before he threw them. his last six throws missed the target entirely. things looked good for the american, but then her behavior also became erratic. she start gazing at each dart, turn them around, touching the point with her thumb and then seemed surprised each time that they were sharp. finally, the match was called on account of both contestants not being able to continue. finally, the disorientated dr. gurtson admitted to the truth. she laced her hands in a hallucinogenic fraud toxin she made in the lab in order to get an edge on her opponent. sadly, the antidote she created for herself didn't work as good as she hoped. in her last statement before being disqualified and ordered off the venue, she said sometimes darts go on the target. sometimes a target comes to you. sometimes i can hear my own smells. whew. go cornhuskers.
