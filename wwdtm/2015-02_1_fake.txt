george bush won the iraq war, al gore invented the internet, and now we can thank kenny g for the starbucks frappuccino. in an interview with bloomberg, the smooth jazz musician explained that he helped create the iconic drink after his uncle introduced him to founder howard schultz. the company was just selling coffee when kenny noticed that a competitor sold a popular blended drink. quote, "i would always call howard and say, howard, there's this thing that they do there that's a milkshake or whatever." so i think that's part of the reason they did the frappuccino. i'd like to think i was partially responsible for that. now i know what you're thinking. you're thinking typical celebrity hyperbole. oh, you doubters. a starbucks spokesman confirmed the story telling people magazine, kenny is a dear friend of starbucks and an early investor in the company. that's true.
