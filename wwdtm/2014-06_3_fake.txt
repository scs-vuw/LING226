cesar chavez was a civil rights activist who devoted his life to gaining rights for farm workers and latinos - but he didn't show half the commitment of arizona congressional candidate, scott fistler. fistler, running in a heavily hispanic district after losing as a republican in 2012, has changed his party affiliation to democrat and legally changed his name from scott fistler to - you guessed it - cesar chavez.  the candidate formerly known as scott fistler refuses to comment on the name change - quote, "there is simply not enough cesar chavez to go around" - he's written cryptically on his website, which does feature photos of crowds carrying signs with the name chavez. the photos are actually of venezuelans rallying for deceased former president, hugo chavez. to be fair, if you say scott fistler with a hispanic accent, it sounds nothing like cesar chavez - but scott fistler just doesn't roll off the tongue.
