lithuania is a former soviet satellite. lithuania has the highest murder rate in the european union. and yet, tourism in lithuania is down.  : and so, three lithuanian buddies came up with a novel way to sell their home country: air fresheners. not only those pine tree-shaped things you see dangling from rearview mirrors, but scented candles and perfume, all infused with the unforgettable smell of lithuania.  : the organizer behind this effort claims the national perfume will do for lithuania what leprechauns have done for ireland, what the cuckoo clock has done for switzerland, and what crushing debt has done for america.  : put their country back on the map. the lithuanian scent is infused with a mix of bergamot, raspberry and grapefruit, with base notes of amber, tree moss and patchouli. scents that were rejected include: sausage, cigars and the raw smell of fear.
