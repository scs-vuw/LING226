as an advice columnist, i spend a lot of time reading through psychology journals to ensure that i give the most up-to-date advice. but this week, i got a letter that made me wish i'd spent more time on netflix. it came from a guy who called himself devastated. he said he knew his girlfriend was cheating on him. she had also falsely accused him of hitting her. he described the whole mess, quote, "it's tearing me apart." i ran his letter in my column, and i gave him pretty good advice, i thought. turns out, i was pranked by someone describing the basic plot to the cult movie "the room," a movie famous for being the worst movie ever made. and about 10,000 people have enjoyed letting me know that i got trolled, like a commentator on the av club website who wrote  you'd think with all of her appearances on wait wait ...don't tell me, she'd be hip to the joke. i'm looking forward to it blowing over, though, so i can get back to helping real people, like that girl who can't pick between her vampire boyfriend and her best friend the werewolf.  i'm looking forward to that.
