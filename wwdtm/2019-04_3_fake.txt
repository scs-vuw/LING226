when 75-year-old wanda krahnsen  ran for mayor of baker city, ore., it was on a pledge to, quote, "restore fiscal responsibility, old-fashioned values and good grammar." that's right - grammar. ms. krahnsen, as she's known to three generations of baker city children, was an english teacher at south baker middle school for 45 years and spoke passionately during her campaign about how improper grammar amongst millennials is emblematic of society's overall decline. after she easily won election last fall, she had the clout to convince the city council to pass the getting ready to affirm momentous modifications about recitation act - or grammar act - which went into effect this week, making the following conversational crimes, well, actual crimes - using lol or other internet jargon in conversation, using like anywhere in a sentence other than to indicate approval and using the word literally literally anywhere except when it's literally mandatory that you use the word literally.   violators will be forced to put $5 in the grammar jar, a giant 6-foot-tall mason jar that has been installed outside city hall. this law is, like, so stupid, 26-year-old bethany urbina  told the baker city herald. yeah, i totally said like. so what? this town has gone #insane. at which point, police grabbed bethany, cuffed her and dragged her off to the grammar jar. as she disappeared out of sight, bethany was heard calling out, help. i'm literally being tortured.
