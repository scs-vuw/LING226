the head of the linguistics department at columbia university is a widely respected educator who has published seven books and given thousands of lectures over the last 30 years. sadly, to his students, professor vincent chase is just the guy with the same name as the lead character from "entourage." professor chase, or aquaman, as he's known to many of his students, teaches an intro to linguistics course that's very popular with many freshmen. i'd like to think it's because my class is so compelling, said professor chase, but i know what's really going on. i spent an hour lecturing about the power of language and noam chomsky, and at the end all they ever ask me is, why do you put up with ari? he's such a jerk. it probably doesn't help that i also have a turtle in my office, a diamond backed terrapin that i've had for 20 years. and everyone wants to know if it's my little fat buddy from queens boulevard. oddly enough, professor chase harbors no ill will towards the show or the character. i quite like "entourage," he admits. he has to deal with the pressures of being famous, making movies and young women constantly throwing themselves at him. and i have to deal with people thinking i'm him; we're actually a lot alike.
