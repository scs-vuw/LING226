leggo my political influence. when dennis red gallagher was in bed with the flu for the better part of a week, not surprisingly, he got bored with hours and hours of daytime television. until he noticed something a bit odd in a commercial repeatedly aired for eggo waffles. "at first i thought i was out of my head with fever, but by the fourth time i saw it, i was sure. if you look at the waffle on the guy's plate, it says no obama in a pattern of squares darkened by butter and syrup."  "it's only on for a second, just after the guy hugs his kid and the puppy licks his face." kellogg's pr vice president emma heinzing claims that eggo toaster waffles - available in your freezer section - are a delicious breakfast or anytime nutritious snack and that syrup and butter are distributed with the intent of enhancing the visual appeal of the waffle itself. any resemblance to any other type of message within the tasty waffles squares is purely coincidental. in what kellogg's claims to have been an unrelated story, ellie mcgee, food designer, was fired and the commercial pulled.
