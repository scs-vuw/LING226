if you're british cobbler martin connellan and the temperatures in your workshop fall to ten degrees fahrenheit because the doors are left open to vent toxic fumes, you do the right thing. you buy your workers coats. if they're still cold and complaining, you do the other thing. you hire a hypnotist to make them think they're warm.  after a five-minute session with hypnotist james kerwin, they've been stripping down to their shorts and t-shirts. worker adam hood said, "i definitely feel better. all my life i've had cold hands and that's even gone." "i bought them all jackets, but they were still moaning," said a delighted mr. connellan. "i didn't think it would work, but soon they were complaining about how hot they were." hypnotist kerwin explained, "it's all about mind over matter, programming people like you would a computer." perhaps next on the employee reboot: that's not frostbite, it's a heat rash. go back to work.
