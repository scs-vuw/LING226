ever goof around with colleagues at work? norman vegor and casey byrd, employees at iowa's xenia rural water district, loved to kid around and greet each other in unusual ways, like, say, waving a boom of a truck hoe at each other.  : one day, vegor's hands were full, so he wiggled his butt at byrd to say hello. byrd planned to answer by playfully tapping vegor with his truck's mirror, but hit him with the truck bed instead. the ensuing worker's comp claim was contested by the company, who said the two men were horsing around and the injury, therefore, not covered. a trial court agreed, but the iowa supreme court just overturned the decision and sent the case back to the compensation board to determine whether the bottom wave can be considered part of vegor's job. in other words, if the booty bump was legit, or it's no ifs, ands or butts.
