the city of madrid thought it had found a high-tech solution to its very low-tech problem of dog poop. the spanish city streets have been plagued with poop problems for years, with thousands of dog owners more keen to pick up a cafe con leche than their doggy's doodies. exasperated city officials invested 3 million euros on a pilot program of 10 poop bots which use sensors to detect feces in public areas, scoop them up with robotic trowels and collect them for later proper disposal. things were going great for the first few weeks until sanitation officials started noticing a problem. the poop bots stopped picking up poo. we don't know what is the problem, sighed sanitation director francisco fernandez .   one day the robots are picking up the caca no problem.   the next day, less caca and less and so on. witnesses report some of the robots seem to avoid the offending areas on purpose, making hard turns or wide circles to keep away, instead choosing to pick up piles of leaves or food wrappers. the entire program has been put on hold while the robots are examined and rebooted. it seems even robots don't want to deal with doo-doo.
