a student studying animal cognition at the university of michigan used a lot of hamsters for experiments. hamsters, as all of you know, if you have a kid with a hamster in his bedroom, spend all night running in their hamster wheels, at least we think that's what they're doing because who's going to stay up all night watching hamsters? well, university of michigan students.  in a series of nocturnal observations using night-vision glasses and one-way mirrors, the students left the labs' cage doors open at night, and as soon as the labs' lights were turned off and the students were behind the one-way mirror, the hamsters got out of their cages, formed small groups, began patrolling the lab, investigating door frames and window ledges and inspecting computer screens and keyboards and pooping on lab notes.  and then they went back in their cages and ran some more. i'm afraid there's really only one conclusion we can draw from this data: hamsters are training for a mission. and we don't know what that mission is.  and we don't know which side the hamsters are on.  so when you're giving a kid a goodnight kiss in his bedroom with a hamster in it, make sure the hamster cage is latched tight, and make sure your kid is armed.
