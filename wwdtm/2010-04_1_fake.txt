in a caper so stupid it's kind of genius, a polish man was recently arrested for mailing himself to businesses, then robbing the joints. stanislaw muchy, 39, was delivered in a large, sealed box and climbed out at night to steal money and other valuables. his getaway plan? instead of leaving through a door or window, he taped himself and his loot inside another large box, presumably with prepaid postage that was addressed to his warsaw home. investigators can't explain why none of his victims were alarmed by a huge, honking box addressed to some random guy, but they mailed him back several times. he was only caught because an accomplice, the guy who delivered him to the courier office, finally tipped off police. quote, we arranged a special delivery of our own, said a police spokesman
