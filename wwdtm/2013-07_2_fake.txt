this week, the whole world was on royal baby watch, and security had never been tighter at the lindo wing of st. mary's hospital, where the duchess of cambridge was set to deliver the most amazing baby human ever.  despite the surveillance, it was helen cromett, a 23-year-old nurse at st. mary's hospital, who accidentally discovered what scotland yard missed, that a visiting surgeon turned out to be a sneaky journalist intent on scooping the royal birth. the dashing dr. oliver grantham was hugely popular, according to helen. she says: at first we all loved him because he was very charismatic and even paired his scrubs with different color csrocs each day.  but then nurse cromett began to notice some strange behaviors. dr. grantham would use the word stat way too often. his accent would go in and out, and he'd say he was going to the vending machine to buy chips rather than crisps. helen reports: so during a late-night shift, i started asking him about his home, and he said his family are from yorkshire, and his sisters are called mary, edith and sybil.  i realized he was reciting plot points from "downton abbey."  it turns out dr. grantham was a wily american blogger named chad lamar with a fake hospital id, a fake accent and excellent taste in television.
