have you ever been nostalgic for the days when our newsrooms were filled with the sound of typewriters, dozens of them, clacking busily away as desperate copywriters on deadlines scurried to churn out their scoops? well, this week, some journalist are starting to become nostalgic for the days after that noise went away because for staffers at rupert murdoch's times of london, it's back. not the typewriters, just the sound. as part of an experiment to make journalists feel more productive and connected, a large speaker has been placed on a tall stand in the middle of the floor for the express purpose of loudly piping in the clattering sounds of the busy newsrooms of yesteryear. a times competitor, the independent, points out that most staffers won't get that nostalgic thrill because it's been 30 years since newspapers did away with typewriters and 20 years since one of murdoch's other holdings, foxnews, did away with news.  and though the times' lucia adams calls it, quote, "a playful idea," a helpful twitter response suggested, quote, "why don't they just pump in the noise of screaming tortured souls in hell?"
