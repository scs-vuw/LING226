a lot of weird things happen in bizarrely mesmerizing musical "cats." grizzled cats ascend to feline heaven on a dilapidated tire. a bisexual tomcat named rum tum tugger struts in a way that leaves you disturbingly turned on. and you exit the theater humming "memory" against your will. but nothing in the show's 36-year history has ever compared to what happened this week during a broadway performance when a real, live dog started chasing a real fake cat during the show's opening number. the service dog took a liking or perhaps wanted to take a licking to the character of bombalurina. if your "cats" wiki is rusty, it's worth reminding you that bombalurina is a very sensual, kittenish red cat with a bright white chest who wears a black-spiked, jeweled collar. in other words, she's irresistible, even if you're a service dog who should be on best behavior because you're extremely lucky to be attending an andrew lloyd webber revival.   during the opening song "jellicle songs for jellicle cats," the pooch, like many folks who attend "cats" for the first time, couldn't control its enthusiasm for feline people dressed in unitard, singing the poems of t.s. eliot. it leapt on stage. a fast-moving usher pulled the dog off the stage, preventing it from humping bombalurina's legwarmers. the mutt was then returned to its mortified owner. the show went on, and every audience member must have said of the dog's performance, i laughed. i cried. it was better than "cats."
