conservative commentator and fox news contributor michelle malkin has expressed her fear that there are muslims amongst us who are hiding their true identity. the most prominent, she claims, being barack obama. however, when she set out to find proof of these undercover muslims, she found more than she bargained for. it turns out that there are, indeed, some muslims hiding their identity to fly under the radar. the most pertinent one for malkin being her own grandfather.  yes, grandpa malkin, who is from the philippines but lives with michelle's parents, had not told the family about his religion for fear of being ostracized and thrown out. "do you know how hard it is to pray five times a day when your family doesn't know?"  "i had to excuse myself to the bathroom every time i wanted to pray."  " and the ham dinners, don't get me started on the ham dinners."  malkin was in shock when her grandfather revealed his true identity to her. he explained that he had been closeted muslim for too long and it was time for him to live his life and be happy with himself. malkin used the revelation to confirm her argument that muslims are taking over. first they wanted the youth, and now they're going after my grandfather? my 90-year-old grandfather? this is sick.
