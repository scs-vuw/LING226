pta president beth ann schulte was determined that her 7-year-old daughter, olivia, would raise the most money in her classroom's annual wrapping paper fundraiser - so determined that when she saw the "frozen" themed christmas paper, she called the distributor and scooped up all 10,000 roles for $50,000. the delighted schulte immediately listed her stash for sale at cost on craigslist and ebay causing a flood of princess elsa fans to her door. but then her neighbors called the police and the city of dallas charged her with running an illegal business out of her home, reports the dallas morning news. undaunted, schulte contended that all the wrapping paper was for friends and personal use and she covered her garage door, her mailbox, her kitchen, her bath and the dog crate with it to prove it. a dallas county judge ruled last week that schulte is engaging in, quote, "a temporary charitable endeavor," unquote, and not profiting. so she's in the clear. oh, and he ordered five roles for his granddaughter.
