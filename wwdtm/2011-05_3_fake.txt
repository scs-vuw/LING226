somebody did it. i think we've all thought of it, but finally someone has done it. energy giant bkw fbm is just waiting on the funds to start work on a solarpowered submarine. the company says the sub would draw power from a floating solar array of five generators with 430 square feet of panels. the sub could dive to depths approaching 1,000 feet, and shoot through the water at almost six miles per hour. it's unclear what the use for a solar submarine would be. an enemy might be able to find a submarine that drags five generators each with 430-square feet of panels. they're kind of like lobster traps with weapons. not so useful. still, somebody finally did it.
