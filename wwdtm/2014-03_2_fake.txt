dave's convenience store in hookset, new hampshire, looks like an ordinary quickie stop until you see the grammatically challenged sign in the window: the home of smell the ham. and then you go inside, and there's an elaborate pink shrine worthy of a saint's relic. in the middle of it is a dried, grayish piece of deli ham covered in clear plastic. a glance at the guest book shows the ham has been sniffed by tourists from canada, japan, brazil. oh yeah, they all smell the ham, says david bettincourt, the proprietor and owner of the ham. the question asks itself: why? in 2004, dave says, he picked up the piece of then-fresh ham and sniffed it. as he did, a mail truck crashed through the front of the store, missing him by inches. i'm not a religious man, said bettincourt, so i credit the ham.   since then the ham has become a legend. brides stop by to smell the ham on the way to the church. the high school girls' basketball team has been undefeated since they all ham-sniffed last year.   and dave sold a winning lottery ticket to a ham sniffer last year, as well. dave doesn't question the ham's power; it's one of life's mysteries.
