wayne ogden of bloomington, indiana advised his college student son zachary to minor in philosophy and major in something more practical. but zachary didn't want to let anything keep him from his dream, and got his degree in philosophy. if his dream included living in his parent's basement for two years, texting a lot, forgetting how to do his own laundry and sleeping until noon, after staggering home from the local bar each night, he was wildly successful.  wayne ogden had many man-to-man talks with his son about making one's own opportunity, working one's way up or at least getting dressed and not leaving half-eaten cup noodles cups all over the house. when none of it seemed to take, he broke into a neighbor's house, stole some jewelry, electronics and cash and planted evidence that would incriminate his son zachary.  "i wasn't trying to send him to jail," wayne ogden explained to a courtroom full at his trial for breaking and entering and fraud, "i just wanted to see him put on a suit."  "i know he did it out of love," says zachary. "i hope he's proud of me now. i visit him every week. i think the structure is helping me."
