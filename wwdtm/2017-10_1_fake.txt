as anyone who's ever seen a spy movie knows, a thick beard can make a great disguise. and for years, gal vallerius remained safely anonymous behind his long, lavish whiskers. the french drug kingpin used his plentiful face fur to blend in with the hipsters and criminals who knew him only as oxymonster. but as david letterman and joaquin phoenix can tell you, there is such a thing as too much beard pride. vallerius was so enamored with his own luxurious chin blanket that he entered himself into the world beard and mustache championships in texas, an international gathering of furry- faced men and the rash-faced women who love them.  : hoping to compete in the full beard, 30.1 to 45 centimeter category. vallerius and his full-on facial follicles were caught entering the country on route to the event. it was the frenchman's first time traveling to the states and gave u.s. authorities a prime opportunity to nab him. evidence found on his computer could put the bearded drug dealer away for life. i don't know anything about the other stuff that he did. but as far as his beard goes, it's really awesome - long and bright red, said one of the contest organizers. it's unclear whether vallerius will be allowed to keep his impressive face mane while in custody. but chances are this duck dynasty will ultimately be cut short.
