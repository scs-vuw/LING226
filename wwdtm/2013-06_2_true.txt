city dwellers dread the occasional pigeon bombing, and sometimes it seems as if they're actually aiming at you. it turns out they are.  pigeons have learned that pooping on people gives them a feather up in the urban jungle. like coloration and nesting habitat, airborne droppings are an evolutionary adaptation, according to a new study by nyu ornithologist jason vest. over the past 10 years, vest tracked a shift from stationary objects - statues, windowsills - to any human within a 60-foot radius, both sitting or moving.  quote, "if you set aside the gross factor, it's actually very impressive. i've seen pigeons fly over and nail a pedestrian from 20 feet high."   of course vest concedes that some birds are more aggressive than others. one of his marked research specimens, s476, nicknamed sniper...  ...was especially adept at targeting passersby. quote, "i swear that pigeon could spot a bald guy from 100 feet away."  "he was kind of a badass."
