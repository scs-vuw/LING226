it's been two years since the last harry potter movie was released and well over four since the last novel was published, but that hasn't slowed down the rash of harry potter- inspired injuries in the u.k. it seems that whenever the wildly popular j.k. rowling books are discovered by a new generation, britain's ers become packed with potter-related injuries such as burns from jumping into fireplaces to teleport, groin splinters from broomsticks, along with bone fractures from leaping from roofs attempting to play quidditch. in the past two years, over 14 children have been treated for concussions after running into the seventh and eighth pillar at the train stations.  in an attempt to catch the last express train to hogwarts. rowling recently made light of the rash of injuries by saying: i don't know what all the fuss is about. let's face it, none of these kids are going to cure cancer.
