being an nfl referee is a thankless job. at the end of the day, all you can hope is that you made some decent calls, gained a little respect from the players and forced hall of fame quarterback steve young to marry your daughter, or at least that was one ref's hope, apparently. in his new memoir, young tells the story of his days as a tampa bay buccaneer. quote, "partway through the second quarter, i'm in the huddle when the head referee taps me on the shoulder. can i talk to you for a second, he says. i step away from the huddle. hey, listen, my daughter's going to byu. next thing i know, he starts trying to convince me that i should meet his daughter." but the striped matchmaker was not done yet. near the end of the game, young took a hard sack and committed a critical fumble, which looked like it was going to cost tampa the game. that is until the ref in question threw a flag negating the play. young claims the ref then casually walked past him and whispered, she likes italian food.
