and so last week the city council announced an all-out effort to import enough hipsters, gays and gay hipsters to resettle motown, to spread coolness, style and gentrification along with bow ties, clever little hats and mason jar upon mason jar full of artisanal olives.  targeted ads will soon pop up in lower manhattan and the bay area, west hollywood and, of course, portland, with slogans like you have a dream of an awesome coffee house; we have a house.  and you like renovating loft spaces? how about an abandoned factory? and detroit: our cars are locally sourced. and my personal favorite, a photo of two handsome, happy young men with the slogan come join us, we're michigay for detroit.
