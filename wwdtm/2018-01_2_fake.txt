have you ever been playing fetch with your dog and thought, wow, he's got some great muscle tone? i wish i could be as fit as fido. a new exercise program at a gym in barcelona aims to do just that by bringing doggy fitness to humans. , or fetching for people, aims to stick it to body fat using sticks.   the fetcher-cise  program is pretty much what you would expect. trainers repeatedly hurl sticks as far as they can...   ...prompting clients to sprint after them, retrieve the sticks and sprint back.   trainer jorge gonzalez  says it's a rigorous regimen. some of my clients just bend down to pick up the sticks with their hands. but if i have a client who really wants a good workout, i make them pick up the sticks with their mouth, just like a dog would. sure, you get dirt and mud and leaves in your face, but great news - dirt has no calories.
