the job holden caulfield wanted was "catcher in the rye," standing next to a cliff to keep kids playing in the grass from falling over. isn't that sweet? the job i want is a new job, a job so far available only in england. the norfolk county council over there created this job, we learned this week, because the local library was plagued by schoolchildren running about, screaming and shouting. the job: library bouncer.  oh man, it might not look good on my resume, library bouncer, and it might not pay so well, but i could so get into it. this is a damn library! is there no place in this land where a person can sit quietly and read? get that shouting and screaming out of here, i would say on my bullhorn - and then i would tase 'em.
