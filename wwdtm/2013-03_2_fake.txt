those yanks think they know everything, but reverse roads on them and they're like fish flopping out of water. on britain's sky tv's new hit show, "the other side," americans are picked up on camera at heathrow rental car counters, and watched as they drive on british roads.  some episodes follow unsuspecting yanks as they plunge into the maze of london. others use dashboard cameras to watch the americans' faces as they drive 80 miles an hour on the, quote, wrong side of a superhighway.  a popular drinking game is taking a swig every time you yell "other side" at the tv, as yanks drive down the right side of a left-hand road.  the network censors stay pretty busy bleeping out words the americans to curse god, queen and country as they spend hour after hour trying the wrong way in a circle, trying to escape the traffic circles.  another yank made the mistake of asking a scot for directions. even native englishmen don't understand it when they talk.
