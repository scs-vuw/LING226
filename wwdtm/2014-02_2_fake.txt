when chilean president sebastian pinera found out his actor/brother pablo had landed a gig as the face of a chain restaurant, he was happy, until he found out that the restaurant was chili's. quote, the best thing about living in chile is eating at chili's, gushes pablo in one ad. have you tried our  desert potato skins? says chilean press secretary jaime carne, if the restaurant in question was olive garden, tgifriday's, even chi-chi's, the president would understand. but touting chili's as the best thing about chile is undignified. chile is a democracy now, and there's no stopping pablo pinero. says pablo, have you tried our new tierra del fuego extra-spicy chili? only at chili's in chile.
