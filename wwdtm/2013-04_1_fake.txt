says innar magnuson of reykjavik, everyone in iceland has heard the story. you're at a family reunion, and that girl looks familiar. is she - indeed, she is - someone you hooked up some time ago?  maybe in hollywood, it's a cute premise, but in real icelandic life, it's not a good feeling when you realize that girl is your cousin.  the problem is most icelanders are at least distantly related because they share descent from a party of ninth-century vikings. the solution? the smartphone anti-incest alarm.  a widely available database traces icelandic family lines back several centuries. it's called the icelandingbach or, as we might put it back home, mama and them.  now, that database has given rise to an app whose slogan is bump the app before you bump in bed.  potential icelandic couples, if they both have the app, can bump their phones together, and the alarm either goes, uh-uh, in effect, or it doesn't. doubt it's reliable? test it on your sister.
