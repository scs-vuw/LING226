back in the '40s, germany's dassler brothers had it all. they ran a successful shoe business together, lived together. heck, they had even joined the nazi party together. but their fairly tale story came to an end in 1948 when a fight broke out between them and a livid rudolph dassler abruptly moved out, moved across the aurach river and set up a rival shoe business. adolph "adi" dassler, renamed his company adidas, while rebellious rudolph christened his puma. and in the ensuing decades, sleepy herzogenaurach became a town where an adidas man dared not show his face in a puma restaurant and vice versa. it was like der sharks and das jets, but with much less shiny, more ergonomic footwear.  well, just this september, the feud came to an official end as the new heads of the companies shook hands to mark world peace day. but it came too late for adolph and rudolph, who died 30 years ago and are now buried in the same graveyard on opposite ends, of course, but for their mourners, just a quick jog.
