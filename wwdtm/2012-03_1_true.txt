"what's the point of spending 20 grand on a new knee if nobody sees it," said co-developer dr. yan butner.  : this generation has been wearing their hearts on their sleeves for over sixty years. they want to wear their new elbows there too.  : custom molded to body contours and just a millimeter thick, including articulating carbon ligaments, the bondable surface can be covered with a variety of fabrics, leathers, even devices. get the snap-on duffer's knee with clips for tees and scorecards.  : switch it over to the static-free ballroom dancer for under your tux at the club social that evening. for the ladies, it can even match your evening gown. hip replacement? nothing puts a bounce in your stride like a new joint and a fanny pack combination.  :"there are no end to the possibilities," claims butner, who denies being sent to earth by the borg from "star trek next generation."  : but admits they do look kind of cool.
