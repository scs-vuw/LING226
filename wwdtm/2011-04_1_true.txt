rockville, maryland has tried everything to deal with young speed demons tearing down tuckerman lane. "speed bumps didn't work. stop light cameras issuing tickets didn't make a difference," said city manager steven oaks. "we realized the only thing that might stop these kids from speeding is the sight of a little old lady shuffling across the street."   and so, the city turned to harlequin dinner theater and hired six elderly actresses to cross the street at regular intervals. myrna davis, last fall's mother superior from "sound of music," pushes a granny cart with groceries to make herself especially vulnerable. evelyn franzen and luli markham, hot off a sold out run of "arsenic and old lace," work in tandem.   evelyn helping luli, who pretends to be blind. drivers have indeed noticed and reacted with their horns.   rockville now has a noise pollution problem equal to a third world megalopolis.   "i took this gig pretending to be a little old lady," said luli markham, "now i'm suffering total hearing loss."
