the wal-mart in chicopee, mass., is live-tweeting their meat department. and by that, we mean a flock of carrion-eating birds have been chowing down at their meat display counter. one customer who discovered the birds - possibly small vultures hopping from package to package, drilling their beaks down through the plastic wrap to the red meat inside, complained to an employee. the customer claimed they made it seem like it was a normal thing. as an employee removed the top shelf of meat, the startled birds flew away. and then the birds came right back, says another customer. a wal- mart spokesman said they hired a professional who removed 17 birds from the store. but let's face it, wal-marts are big. there could be more birds in there that nobody knows about. it's a giant store. they could have a pack of wild dogs over in house wares or a conspiracy of lemurs in the automotive section. wal-marts are huge; they have their own school districts. these meat-eating birds could just be escapees from an in-store aviary that wal-mart management doesn't yet know about. a wal-mart spokesperson says the company has put additional safeguards in place to try to prevent a similar situation in the future, but did not elaborate on what those measures are. we can only speculate that it is a large pride of feral cats.
