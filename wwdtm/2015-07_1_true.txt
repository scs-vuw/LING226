for those of you who don't own a tv or live in the south or go to sports bars where you're talking to friends and my face suddenly appears in the background, i should tell you i have been in a series of sonic commercials for sonic drive-in that have been playing every 15 minutes on every channel for the last 20 years.   i'm the guy in the driver's seat. but you may have noticed that we never actually drive anywhere. we're like two characters in a beckett play about hamburgers.   this has been to my advantage over the years because i cannot drive. i grew up in new york. i went to college, and i lived in chicago for 15 years. i live in new york now, and so i just never learned how to drive. this hadn't been an issue until this week, when the good people from sonic came up with an idea for a commercial that started with me driving the car into the parking spot. i was too embarrassed to admit to my lack of motor skills, so i said sure, i'll do it, figuring - how hard could it be? well, for me, the answer turned out to be very, very hard. first, i shifted into neutral. and then after realizing the little d stands for drive, i pressed on the gas with all the gusto of the duke boys trying to outrun boss hogg, and i slammed our car into the side of the restaurant. fortunately, no one was hurt and sonic has a very good insurance policy that specifically covers them against grown men too proud to admit they're less coordinated than the average 16-year-old.
