big league baseball is a tough game. that's why los angeles angels pitcher jerome williams was incorrectly called jeremy for two years after joining his first big league team, the san francisco giants. "they just called me that," says williams. "i just rolled with it. i was a rookie, and i didn't want to tell anybody, because i was scared." he believes that the relief pitcher, felix rodriguez, was the first to mistakenly call him jeremy, and the others just followed suit. he recalls that manager felipe alou was the only one who didn't mistakenly call him jeremy for two years. "felipe never really called me by my name. he was just like 'hey guy, come here, guy. '"  : after two years, however, he felt comfortable enough with pitching coach dave righetti to tell him that his name was jerome, not jeremy. in another year or so, he may reveal that he is a second baseman.  : or, perhaps, that he never played baseball at all, until when delivering clean uniforms to the locker room, felipe alou said, "hey guy, get dressed and get out there."
