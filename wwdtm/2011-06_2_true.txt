when the hub tv network launched it's reboot of the my little pony's tv franchise, my little pony's "friendship is magic," they hoped that by adding slightly more complex plots and jokes they might be able to snag a slightly older audience, like say, four year olds.  so imagine their surprise when the show became a huge hit with unemployed adult men in their 20s and 30s who call themselves bronies.  bronies like 32-year-old luke allen of albuquerque wile away their days posting fan videos on youtube, trading ponies. "i'll give you a gently used twilight sparkle for that mint condition "flutter shy."  and likely setting off internet alarms everywhere by cruising my little pony chat rooms for the latest gossip.  they say they love the show for its excellent animation and subtle references to that other hallmark of high school celibacy, "dungeons and dragons."  for their part, the show's creators say they're pleasantly creeped out - flattered, by all the attention.
