the city council in delavan, wisconsin, has launched an investigation of how a police raid went completely to the dogs. on a saturday night late in june, office ken wilcox was cruising around a rural neighborhood outside of town when, while passing a large barn, he heard a cacophony of dogs barking wildly. he immediately called into headquarters and reported that he had stumbled upon a dog-fighting ring. there have been repeated complaints of dog fights being held in the woods in and around delavan. the town swat team mobilized and secured behind riot shields, burst into the barn, breaking up the 14th annual sally walt dog show held by delavan's local aspca.  a golden retriever in the hunting class had gotten out of control and set off some of the other contenders, which is the ruckus wilcox had heard from the street. however, by the time everything had become clear, 17 people, including five handlers, were in handcuffs. at least three dogs had escaped entirely into the night. the baked goods table and silent auctions were in shambles, and champion golden earring, a norwich terrier and last year's best in show, had been tazed into unconsciousness.  he's expected to recover. the community remains outraged. my dog will never be the same, said maude schliss, the owner of golden earring. we used to sit together on the sofa and watch "ncis." now every time he hears a siren, he hides under the couch.
