laney stephens  was always proud of her dad paul's career as a working actor. she'd post on instagram, dad's playing a waiter on "two broke girls," yes, #afterlife, #superstar, #blessed. all of that daughterly adulation came screeching to a halt when papa paul landed a huge national ad campaign for viagra. suddenly, laney's dear old dad was giving suggestive glances to a noticeably younger woman on national television all while a sly voiceover asked, when the moment is right, are you ready? but it got worse from there. the viagra campaign made its way onto a giant billboard only six blocks away from school. nearly all of laney's classmates had the privilege of driving past a nine-foot-wide version of her dad's face emblazoned with the slogan, are you ready? laney never heard the end of it. her new nickname became are you ready? you ruined my life, dad, the teen lamented. dad, feeling bad, attempted to right this wrong the only way an actor would. he took out another billboard featuring a father-daughter photo and a sign saying, laney, i'm ready...   ...to apologize.
