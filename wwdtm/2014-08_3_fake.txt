young people are going back to vinyl for music so why not to paper for news? so the san francisco chronicle has set up a special it line for people who, having grown up online, want to learn how to operate a paper newspaper.  odie milo, who oversees the new helpline, says the most frequently asked question is where do i click to get, like, audio and video?  we tell them it's not really about clicking at all. then when they've sort of absorbed that, we talk them through the process of turning actual, physical pages. they love it when we give them tips like when you have trouble separating two pages, try licking your fingers.  other questions odie milo has fielded are it's so big, why does it have to be so big? and mine won't update. it's stuck on last wednesday.
