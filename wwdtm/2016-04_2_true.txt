police in morecambe, england, were forced to apologize after they issued an apb - that's all puns bulletin - last week when someone pilfered eggs from a chicken sanctuary. quote, "we are asking for assistance with an eggstraordinary crime.  we have scrambled the troops to -  - to try our best to detect this crime. we can't have people ducking justice."  but tina wilkinson, who runs the charity sanctuary called hedwig's house, was not amused. quote, "after the post went up, people were saying that even polic thought i was a joke. i was very upset and felt like giving up the charity." never underestimate the power of a nice old lady if you ruffle her feathers.  police inspector banks-lyon personally apologized to wilkinson, reports u.k.'s visitor. and another facebook post appeared, quote, "it has now been brought to our attention that the humor used in this post has not been interpreted by all with the original intent in mind, which was to try and identify the offender. and we would like to apologize for any offense that this has created."
