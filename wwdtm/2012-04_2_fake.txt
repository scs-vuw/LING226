house plants get bored. that's the conclusion reached by amanda fleece, a forensic botanist at the university of rochester, after she lost patience with a droopy ficus in her apartment. "it had been a reasonably happy plant before," she told the rochester herald leader this week. "but it wilted and none of the kind attention i lavished on it made a difference. so i yelled at it. you're a plant, what in the hell do you want from me, blood?"  :"i could actually see that ficus perk up on the spot. so i mooned it."  :"it perked up further." over the next several days, fleece sang body songs to the ficus, decked it in christmas tree tinsel and threatened to send it away to military school.  : soon, it had doubled in size. "wouldn't you get down," says fleece, "if you stood around all day in a pot? not just ficuses, i call my schefflera, the countess. all my houseplants are flourishing, now that i'm putting some drama in their lives."
