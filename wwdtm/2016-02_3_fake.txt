anyone who has eaten a burrito knows they pack a lot of calories. so in an effort to reduce the caloric intake of the menu items found at chipotle, the corporate brass came up with an innovative idea. they decided to install moving treadmills in place of the floor where people stood in line to give their orders. this would force people to keep walking while waiting in line, thus burning upwards of a hundred calories just while the ordered. brilliant, right? it seemed that way until customers started falling. german tourist wolfgang von grimmelshausen...   ...who ate at the restaurant was quoted as saying  "when i first walked in...   "...i thought this is a great idea. i'm a fit 75-year-old who goes for walks every morning in bavaria. i figured even a baby could handle the treadmill at the burrito shop. but right when i got my chicken burrito with sour cream, someone turned up the treadmill. that's not fair. my supreme burrito went flying...   ...hit the face of the lady behind me. she fell on the man behind her, who then fell on a baby."  she promptly offered to give them free food for a month while they rested and avoided physical activity.  so in the end, these customers gained more weight than if the treadmills had never been installed in the first place.  von grimmelshausen was quoted as saying  "i am now 20 pounds heavier than when i first walked into chipotle. i used to look like a manly man. now i look like a big, fat burrito.   "thank god the baby is ok."
