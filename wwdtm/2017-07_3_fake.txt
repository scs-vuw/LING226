there are two things in this world graham ryfschneider of portland, ore. loves, his girlfriend brooke and his dji mavic pro quadcopter drone with 4k camera and wi-fi. and so when ryfschneider recently decided it was time to pop the question, it seemed only fitting that he would bring together his two favorite things, his lady friend and his flying robot. the idea, as the oregonian newspaper later described it, was to fly the engagement ring in on the drone as the two stood on the picturesque st. johns bridge. the hitch in the plan was that ryfschneider needed someone else to pilot the drone so the proposal could be a surprise. enter graham's friend kurt, whose drone skills could only be described as, quote, "limited."   when the moment of truth came, the drone dropped out of the sky like a stone, clipping graham's head, and this being portland, shearing off his man bun...   ...before tumbling another hundred feet into the willamette river below still attached to the ring. once her terror subsided, brooke did accept graham's proposal. and while the ring is likely gone forever, she told the oregonian she considers that a small price to pay to never have to look at the man bun again.
