many believe moses raised his staff and parted the red sea. now many believe the next man to perform that feat is one jose rivera  of ixtapa, mexico. mr. rivera believes he has found the staff moses used to part the red sea when it fell from the sky and cracked the windshield on his toyota pickup truck.   that was kind of annoying, he said, until he realized he could now perform miracles. every day, he plants the staff in the sand on the beach near his home, and then when the tide comes in, the water flows around it, leaving it high and dry. pilgrims have been coming from all over mexico to see the miracle, all of them paying about $6 for the privilege and many leaving with souvenir, quote, "moses staff miniature replicas," which oddly look a lot like twigs.   when challenged as to how moses' staff from egypt would end up in mexico, jose is quick to point out mexico also has pyramids like egypt, so it's possible the lord was confused.   although pilgrims come on a sunday, scientists visited on a tuesday, paid their admission and said mr. rivera is taking advantage of a natural barrier made of some submerged cinder blocks, which channel the water around the staff. in response, mr. rivera said the lord works in mysterious ways...   ...and with different construction materials.   mr. rivera said he's also discovered what looks like a rusty old trumpet but is really joshua's horn from the bible. and if mr. trump ever builds that wall, jose's going to head up there and blow it and see what happens.
