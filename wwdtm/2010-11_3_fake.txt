the indonesian province of irian jaya received electricity only 30 years ago. since then, the native asmat people have been watching tv nonstop. when american myrtle mccue and her flame- haired best friend, sally tompkins, visited the otherwise primitive region, they learned everything about its culture - everything except the ginger prophecy, the asmat people's belief that two best friends - one frumpy, the other a tireless and starstruck redhead - would come to the island and entertain them for eternity.  quote: at first, when they made us stuff our faces with chocolates, i thought they were being hospitable, said sally. then when they made me walk down a long staircase with a giant headdress on, i became suspicious. when they made me stomp grapes for hours as they chanted babalu, i started to worry.  after an exhausted sally was given medicine laced with alcohol and forced to recite an asmati tongue twister over and over, myrtle contacted the u.s. embassy. it's all pretty ridiculous, said sally. i'm not even a natural redhead.
