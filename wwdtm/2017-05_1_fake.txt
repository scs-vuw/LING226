south dakota has mt. rushmore. new york has niagara falls. and now tom battista says it's finally time for indianapolis to let the tourists of the world in on one of its natural wonders - the small triangle of grass where the i-65 and i-70 freeways meet.   that's right, battista recently got final approval to open something called the idle - a point of view, which will feature chairs and a sunshade designed for watching the freeway traffic as it goes by.   battista says he got the idea five years ago while walking along the freeway, which, it should be noted, is almost never a sign things are going great in your life.   he says the spot will soon become a hot tourist attraction because of how relaxing it is to watch other people battle traffic when you are not actually in it. and if there's one thing battista knows about it's relaxing since for the last 25 years his day job has been as stage manager for the singer jimmy buffett.   no word yet on if buffett plans to write any songs about how he wishes he could just be sitting carefree by the side of two major freeways. but if he does, there's a solid chance it will soon be the favorite song of your mom's new husband, gary.
