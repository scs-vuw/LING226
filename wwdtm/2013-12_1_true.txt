detroit doesn't have enough cops to patrol its streets, but an inventive resident has come up with a way to keep the streets safe, well at least his own street and his own house. sick of having his house broken into, the man, who must remain nameless for security reasons, he's tried everything: security bars; spotlights, guard dogs. and nothing worked. then he got the idea to dress two cpr dummies as gangsters and put them on his porch. the break-ins have stopped.  his quote: they drive by, and they look the place over, and when they see the gangsters on the porch, they just keep going. some of them drive by repeatedly and figure out they're being watched. now he knows this because he's also mounted cameras in the eyes of the dummies to record their activities. i guess it takes a gangster to scare a gangster, or maybe they just avoid the house out of professional courtesy.  whatever the reason, the gangster scarecrows work, and detroit police have stopped by to congratulate him on a novel and clever idea, or they would stop by if they weren't too scared to stop by.
