when you think james bond, you probably think cool gadgets, dry martinis and sexy ladies. you probably don't think crippling fear of heights. but for current bond daniel craig, that's the unfortunate reality. on the set of the most recent bond film "skyfall," craig was chasing a bad guy through an amusement park, and the script called for the pursuit to continue onto a roller coaster. everything was going fine until at the height the coaster's ascent, craig suddenly froze then started hyperventilating and crying like a little boy.  : his mother, who was visiting the set that day, explained why he was acting shaken, not stirred.  :"when danny was nine, we went to a carnival in bristol and he got stuck at the top of a roller coaster, for six hours." the film's producers wasted no time and immediately brought a psychiatrist onto the set, who scurried up the coaster and had craig repeat a calming phrase into a small mirror. "i'm james bond, the coolest man in the world."  :"i'm not little danny craig from cheshire who's afraid of heights. tell me i'll be ok, mommy. tell me i'll be ok." over and over and over.  : their efforts paid off and within minutes, an embarrassed craig was back on the ground. and since he has no deep psychological fear of the dark, the next day the scene was re-shot, this time in the tunnel of love.
