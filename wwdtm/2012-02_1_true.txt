proof that there's more than one sucker born every minute was provided recently to christopher herbert of london. for reasons too complicated to explain here, herbert found himself with a blob of dried glue that to him bore the faint resemblance to homer simpson. to the untrained eye, it also looked like a death's head, an elderly dwight eisenhower, a snarling paramecium and a sonogram of the alien from "close encounters of the third kind."  : nevertheless, herbert put the homer blob up for auction on ebay. the opening price was 99 pence. by close of bidding that day, that price of the blob of dried glue had risen to almost 150,000 pounds. herbert advertised the drop of glue as the "missing piece in any simpson's fans collection." and here, all these years on, we all thought that someone as dumb as homer had to be an exaggeration.
