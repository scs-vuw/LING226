elaine jones perused the dusty aisles of periwinkle's curiosity and rarities shop in berwick-upon-tweeds, england, looking for an antique cricket bat as a birthday gift for her husband theodore. along the way, she found what appeared to be an innocuous thin piece of wood about the size of the palm of her hand. she wasn't sure how it was used, but there was something about it that made it hard to put down. elaine purchased the wood for over 200 pounds. it seemed like a lot of money, but she was sure there would be lots of uses for it. even as she carried it to the front of the shop, she couldn't help swiping her finger across the front of the board where it was darkened and worn from where other users had apparently done the same. as she drove home, she took longer and longer glances at it in the seat beside her. she spent hours staring at the thing. she vaguely suspected she had a problem but was too ashamed to tell anyone.   when elaine sought the expertise of antiques expert david cavel, she learned that the mesmerizing item she had purchased was very popular in the early 1800s. it was a tool for an eye exercise, and some people used it for meditation. they just stared at it. it was called an eyepad , e-y-e.   e-y-e-pad. some users found that swiping their finger across the front of it was somehow stimulating.   they became so popular that it was considered acceptable to stare at the eyepad and ignore those around you.
