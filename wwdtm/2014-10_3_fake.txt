st. paul, minnesota city worker, megan campbell, had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. first, while driving a supply van back from a city storage building, she hit a parked car causing serious damage. darn it. then she discovered that her personal vehicle, a 13-year-old nissan pathfinder, had just been hit by a city supply van driven by none other than herself.  double darn it. she couldn't believe her bad luck. but in a burst of that old minnesotan can-do spirit, she decided to take the lemons life had handed her and squirt them in everybody's eyes.  because i was working for the city and driving a city vehicle, she wrote in her claim for damages, i feel the city is responsible for the damage done to my car.  with winter approaching, twin cities snowplow drivers with aging personal vehicles are watching the outcome of the claim closely and parking on the street.
