if a prairie dog thinks those pants make your butt look big, they'll shout it out. unlike married people and cnn, prairie dogs make and share accurate and detailed observations about all manner of things, including us.  dr. con slobodchikoff spent 25 years studying the sophisticated vocalizations of these charming but unfiltered rodents and found their chirping alerts contained word-like packages of information to share with the rest of the colony. unique sounds were found to both identify specific threats, such as hawks and coyotes, but to also point out details of their appearance. and they do the same thing when talking about humans.  for example, said dr. slobodchikoff, a human alarm call will not only identify the intruder as being human but also contain information about the size, shape, and color of the clothes. so next time don't be fooled by that cute little chirping face at you from the prairie grass. he might be saying: here comes bear butt in those hilarious yellow pants.
