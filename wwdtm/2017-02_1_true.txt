sales of e-books have soared in recent years. customers report enjoying the convenience of being able to bring hundreds of books with them anywhere they go. but what if you don't actually have time to read those books but you still want to sound super smart at parties or on dates? that would be impossible, right? well, not anymore. meet the amazon whisper, which debuted this week. it offers customers the option of having alexa, the amazon echo robot, on standby to whisper plot details and opinions about books into their ears via wireless ear buds.   gone are the days of nodding along like you know what people are talking about.   no more gaffes like saying, boy, they never did find that fountain, did they, in reference to "the fountainhead."   or, and to think he'd one day become u.s. president when the novel "ulysses" by james joyce is mentioned. the service is $5.99 extra per book except for anything written by bill o'reilly, which is an extra $20 because even algorithmic robots have some standards.
