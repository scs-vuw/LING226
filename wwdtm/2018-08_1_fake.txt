kevin cayton had a problem. he had a weekend vacation scheduled in the famous tourist trap that is known as the wisconsin dells, but that wasn't the problem. the problem was that he's a huge arizona wildcats basketball fan, and there was no place to watch the game in the wisconsin dells, not even buffalo phil's pizza & grille, which is under the same roof as knuckleheads bowling and trampoline park.   wisconsin is big ten territory, not pac 12. so kevin did what any true wildcat fan would do. he pretended to be a buffalo phil's employee, and he repeatedly called the restaurant's cable provider to upgrade their tv sports package to include pac 12 games. kevin enjoyed his meals at the buffalo phil's, which, by the way, are delivered by a toy train, and the wildcat games. and he would have gotten away with it if the restaurant owner hadn't noticed a big increase in his cable bill and called the cops. you know how the cable company customer service line always says these calls may be recorded? well, it turns out, they are.   police listened to the tapes of a man calling himself pat barkley calling in to order the upgraded package. and at one point during the call, pat responds to someone in the room saying, hey, it's me, kevin.   kevin cayton was arrested at his place of work, a car dealership in illinois, and he's been charged with felony identity theft and faces up to 12 years in prison, which is kind of ironic as he's a pac 12 fan.
