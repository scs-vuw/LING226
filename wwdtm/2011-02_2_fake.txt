when you talk about the band phish, man, you have to talk about the juicy extended jams and the culture, the fans with the ph man, following the band with the homemade goods and doing drugs and doing strong financial analysis on larry kudlow's show and - wait, what?  that's right, dan greenhaus, chief economic strategist at miller tabak and company recently went on kudlow's cnbc show and dropped a startling number of phish references in a seven- minute segment, which is, of course, much shorter than most phish songs.  greenhaus' analysis of inflation fears included sly shout outs to such songs as "backwards down the number line," "fast enough for you", and "free." greenhaus tipped hit hand on his favorite met band's message board right before his appearance, posting the note: put on cnbc right now. to which most fans replied: why? i'm already wearing a poncho, dude.  anyway, greenhaus isn't resting on his laurels. he vows that next time he'll somehow figure out an ingenious way to cram in a reference to phish's new single, which is tentatively entitled, "the commodity pricing is not a necessary indicator in inflationary pressure shuffle."
