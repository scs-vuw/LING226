there are a lot of things that humans can get that trees don't. trees don't get rabies. trees don't get jokes. you can trust me on that one.  : but it turns out that trees do get jet lag. according to researchers from the university of western sydney, if you flew a tree across several time zones, it would suffer some familiar symptoms. its rhythms would be off, it would still be on yesterday's schedule in its carbon cycle, and it might groggily buy souvenirs that it doesn't really want.  : now, obviously trees don't move, no matter what you might hear from adorably delusional farm girls from kansas. and forests don't move, no matter what you might hear from certain delusional scottish kings. but if they did, well according to dr. victor resco de dios, if you could move a whole forest from sydney to barcelona, all of the trees, in fact the whole ecosystem would likely have the plant equivalent of jet lag. dr. de dios and his team say that their study could actually prove very useful for their work in the increasingly important field of advanced dinner party factoids.
