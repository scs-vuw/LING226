picture the scene at best buy on black friday. now wouldn't it be awesome if president obama sent soldiers into best buy with automatic weapons and basically encouraged low, low prices at gunpoint?  well, this awesome thing is happening in venezuela. times have been tough there lately. they're running out of staples like chicken and toilet paper, and inflation is over 50 percent. so last weekend their president, nicols maduro, took matters into his own militia and ordered the army to occupy a popular chain of electronics stores, the venezuelan best buy, forcing the stores to offer deep discounts, prices so low they had to be delivered on the point of a bayonet. the president went on state television to explain his unusual magnum-force economic policy. he said this is good for the nation. leave nothing on the shelves, nothing in the warehouses, nothing. let nothing remain in stock. in other words, holy santa claus, venezuela, it's insane.
