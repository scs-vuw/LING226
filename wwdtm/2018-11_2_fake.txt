in japan, punctuality is sacred, and being late is deeply embarrassing. and yet, there are always some stragglers who can't quite meet deadlines, which prompted this month's student procrastination day at colleges throughout the country. the celebration is the brainchild of university of tokyo president makoto gonokami, a self-admitted procrastinator who wants to reduce stress and promote mental health at japan's highly competitive universities. students will be allowed to turn in one final paper, regardless of when it was due, on the last day of the semester.   but some students say the new celebration stresses them out. quote, "it's too much pressure to be late," haruto...  ...tanaka  told ntv news. "all my papers are already finished." gonokami says, it might take years to catch on, but, as i always say, better late than never.
