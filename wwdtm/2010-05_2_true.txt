the tiny lincoln library in sioux falls, iowa, knew it was in trouble when its dvd rental collection routinely outperformed their book lending. and so staff members came up with a literary idea to try to draw the public back into the stacks. the plan was for librarians to pair a favorite book with its corresponding cocktail. ideas included pairing jane austen with old fashioneds, mai tais with michener, bloody marys with "dracula" - and, of course, the novel "deliverance" would go along with boone's farm.   last month's kickoff event got off to a raucous start with hemingway's "a moveable feast." to honor the author's hard-drinking habits, they paired the book with shots of absinthe. library patrons went a little crazy. some merely got drunk, but others started hallucinating and running amok. librarian clara gallagher looked on in horror. they went after the card catalog. it was like that scene in "ghostbusters," with cards flying everywhere. other people were making out over there in reference. there were a couple of fistfights in the children's corner. the librarians got the mess cleaned up and put back together just in time for next month's event: ken kesey's moonshine night.
