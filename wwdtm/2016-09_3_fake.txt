hillary clinton isn't the only politician to get into trouble over use of her personal phone. last month, journalists and opposition ministers in south korea found it increasingly difficult to get hold of kristal yong-june , the country's minister for culture and tourism, on her personal cell phone. as complaints mounted, the national assembly launched an internal investigation involving a government official following ministry interns during work hours. the staffer was shadowed to a local park full of young people staring at their phones. consultation with a reporter from the seoul herald solved the mystery. the local park was a popular pokestop for the popular mobile game pokemon go. further investigation revealed the minister had been giving staffers her phone and having them catch rare pokemon. under intense grilling, several interns broke down sobbing, revealing that the minister had been particularly intent on catching several mankeys and dittos. but as committee meetings precluded her from doing so, she instructed them to go catch them all on her behalf. criticism over the affair has been harsh and swift with opposition member park sung yi  blasting, much as igglybuff  evolves into a jigglypuff, we had hoped that korean politics had evolved past this type of self-serving cronyism. for her part, yong-june has expressed remorse for the affair and pledged to commit herself fully to her duties as a minister, adding wryly that she hopes to be the very best like no one ever was.
