having been adopted as a small boy, restaurateur ted mann might well have wondered at one time or another about the identities of his birth parents. he may have thought that he was descended from royalty or maybe a famous theodore. maybe theodore roosevelt or even theodor geuisel, aka dr. seuss. then at 42, the bay ridge native got a call from a sister he never knew he had, who revealed to him that he is, indeed, the son of a famous theodore. and the theodore is ted nugent.  "i'm like, what," laughed mann, who claimed to have had a hard time breathing for a while, not able to leave the house nor pull himself away from the youtube videos of dear new dad, running around crazy onstage. in the first hour of their meeting, ted senior asked ted junior to go shoot guns. suddenly, his pension for waiting tables in a choker collar with a shirtless vest and turning from his customers to waggle his butt and reveal his furry tail made sense.
