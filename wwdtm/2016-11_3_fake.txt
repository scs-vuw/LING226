back in the '90s, the british band oasis was famous for the way the two main members, brothers liam and noel gallagher, fought almost constantly. once, liam hit noel on the head with a tambourine during a concert. then noel hit liam over the head with a cricket bat in the recording studio. and they also spent hours in interviews talking about how much they hated each other. and one time, noel even said of liam, quote, "he's like a man with a fork in a world full of soup." well, this week, the british tabloid the mirror reported that over the years noel gallagher tormented his younger brother liam by exploiting his fear of ghosts. said noel, if we were ever anywhere remotely spooky, we'd tell liam that the house was haunted, particularly his bedroom. and noel's childish scheme to scare his brother like a child was childishly simple. when liam would get up in the morning and leave his room to have breakfast, noel, or someone else from the band, would go into his room and turn all the pictures around or move a lamp to the other side of the room or perform an equivalent low-level prank. and then, when liam returned to his room, he would see these mysteriously relocated objects and run to his band mates to demand an answer. have you been in my bleeping room, he'd ask. no, why, they'd reply. because now the bleeping lamp is in the toilet, he'd respond. no way, bleeping hell, they'd say. the whole thing worked bleeping perfectly and went on for years until being revealed this week, although the younger liam may well get the last laugh in the ongoing war since he recently tweeted a picture of the older noel with a scathing one-word caption, potato.
