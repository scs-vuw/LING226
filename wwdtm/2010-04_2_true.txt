a proposal to sell corporate naming rights to stamps has galvanized the marketing people at the cash-strapped united states postal service. originally, the proposal was merely to sell the opportunity to place on stamps your iconic commercial logo - a golden arches, say, or a set of mouse ears for the disney corporation. now, though, the people in marketing at usps have decided to expand the program to other postal service tie-ins. frequent mailer bonus premiums has been developed wherein a certain number of canceled corporate stamps can get the recipient free products from the companies. the difference between the usps and email is that we are tangible, said walter walworth, an assistant postmaster general. tangibility is our biggest advantage, and it's time to provide people with tangible rewards.
