...rubs the town the wrong way. it's in trouble for offering dr. seuss-themed massages in an effort to get around local zoning laws. whether you want a grinch, a lorax or your massage performed by a fox in socks...   ...many doubt this is what dr. seuss had in mind. valencia has strict zoning laws regarding location of belt-themed businesses. so when arthur conan applied for his business licenses and said it was a relaxing dr. seuss-themed atmosphere, the city council thought an afterschool center was open.  the local parents were up in arms in and want the businesses closed immediately. lois watson, a local mother, complained i don't want to know what goes on in there, and i certainly don't want to have to explain to my children why they can't see what happens to gerald mcboing boing in there.  the cat in the hat couldn't clean this one up. and we can be pretty sure that mr. conan's establishment would not be welcomed by every who in whoville.
