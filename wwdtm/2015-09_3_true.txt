after watching her class of 2 to 4-year-old students play during recess, nursery school teacher avala shickle  devised you're not the boss of me, the nursery school workout. i noticed how incredibly hard young children work when they play. they run, jump, climb and pull themselves up, and they're incredibly flexible. i wondered if adults could do it, she says. shickle filmed her students during playtime and came up with full-sized workouts mimicking exactly what the kids do. athletes moved quickly through a circuit doing the hand-over-hand monkey bar challenge, climbing up the slide and pushing a group on a merry-go-round before jumping on themselves. they played chase for 10 minutes on foot and then for another 10 minutes riding big wheels. in duck, duck, goose, participants sit down cross-legged, and then stand up quickly without using their hands to stabilize and run around in a tight circle. toddler tug-of-war imitates a toddler on a leash pulling one way while someone bigger pulls the opposite. athletes can only hydrate using sippy cups and then only if they ask very nicely.
