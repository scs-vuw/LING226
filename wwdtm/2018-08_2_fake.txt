k-pop, the south korean music sensation consisting of highly successful and highly manufactured male and female pop groups, attracts thousands of adoring fans throughout the south pacific and beyond. but for one superfan, kai jo nakamura , a 31-year-old accountant from japan, watching his favorite combo from the arena floor wasn't enough. when the popular troupe bisan superfire  swung through the osaka-jo arena, kai jo saw his chance to get up close and personal with his idols. nakamura laid low, and then, once the show started, he sprung into action. there's 13 members in the group, said superfire lead singer day sun wo , so when there's an extra person onstage, you don't really notice it at first.   helping nakamura in his deception was that he had studied the band's fashion sense and dance moves closely. i mean, despite the fact he's quite a bit older than us, he really looked like a part of the group, said jai hot 90 , one of the band's four rappers. arena security didn't notice the extra body until three songs in when each member give themselves a shout-out. i was like, who the hell is kai nak , said hot 90. nakamura is currently in custody awaiting trial on charges of trespassing and identity theft but says he is already planning a tour of his own upon release.
