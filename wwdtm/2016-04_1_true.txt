air travel can be trying as it is, so the last thing you need is someone - in this case the pilot - giving you the hard sell over the intercom for one of those multilevel-marketing scams. but that's precisely what happened on a recent delta flight from salt lake city to houston, forcing ceo richard anderson to issue the following apology - we at delta deeply regret our pilot's decision to use the intercom to let our valued passengers know that they could make thousands of dollars from home simply by hosting fun candle parties.  anderson wrote on the company website - i mean, yes, i'll admit it, it sounds great to make money by inviting your friends over to buy something they already need. and yes, we'd all love it if our commute was just walking to the mailbox each month to pick up our check. but flight 2046 out of salt lake was neither the time nor the place to have that conversation and certainly not over the plane's pa system. i've talked to jeff, the pilot in question, who now realizes how unprofessional his behavior was. although in his defense, he only needed to sign up eight more people before he qualified for one year's free use of a dodge stratus, or candle car as it's referred to in the industry. to make it up to passengers on the flight, delta's offering them free airfare anywhere in the u.s. provided that when they land, they're willing to attend a short low-pressure informational session about vacation timeshare opportunities that could be perfect for them and their family.
