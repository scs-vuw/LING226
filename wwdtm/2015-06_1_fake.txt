the lunch rush at an indian restaurant can be pretty hectic. if there's a lunch special, it gets even crazier. that must be the reason why the owner of india castle in cambridge, mass. has had an old poster of the tv show "entourage" hanging in the front of his place for five years and hasn't even noticed it. rabhbir singh, owner of india castle, who said he's never even heard of the show, first denied having the poster in his restaurant. then, he walked to the front and remembered, oh, this; this has been here forever.  singh said a representative from a local tv station made him a deal. let us come change the poster in the box every two weeks, and we'll pay you. in what sounds like a ploy straight from the tv show's shady agent, ari gold, singh said he can't remember how much he was supposed to be paid because a representative put the "entourage" poster in and never came back. in an even shadier move, the rep didn't even give singh a key to open the frame. now singh is left with a poster he doesn't want from a show he doesn't know, in a stupid case he can't get rid of. so until a locksmith volunteers to help mr. singh open the case and get rid of the old poster, he will have to keep walking by, wondering, who the hell are these guys, and why can't i get them off my wall?
