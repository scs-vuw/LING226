aluk verma  is a 29-year-old social media celebrity from dubai who got very rich and famous for being, well, rich and famous. he was one of his nation's first reality tv stars. think of him sort of as the tim kardashian of the united arab emirates. so you might say it's somewhat ironic that it was a social media-related stunt that landed him in the hospital this week. as the khaleej times reported, verma was just the latest high-earner in the uae to injure himself taking part in something called the scrooge mcduck challenge, where very rich people - let's be honest - very rich guys. women would never be stupid enough to do this....   ...liquidate their entire fortunes into gold, silver and diamonds, then fill a swimming pool with the treasure and then dive in.   the problem, as verma and a surprisingly high number of other dudes in dubai have learned through personal experience, is that scrooge mcduck is a cartoon character.   and in the real world, where we all live, the treasures, though individually small, come together to form an impenetrable solid mass...   ...a mass that broke both of verma's wrists, caused a compression fracture of his spine and left him with no actual memory of the event. the last thing i remember, i was at the bank, he told the newspaper. and then i was waking up in a hospital bed, and they were telling me i might lose the vision in my right eye because i'd gotten a doubloon stuck in it.   doctors do expect verma's memory to return eventually, and his wrists and back should heal just fine, too. the vision damage, though, in his eye - that might be permanent, something verma is taking in stride. worst-case scenario, he said from his hospital room, i'll have to wear a monocle, just like my new hero, scrooge mcduck.
