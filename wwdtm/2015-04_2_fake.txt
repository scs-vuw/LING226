the family members of william hanna of hanna-barbera fame have discovered a wacky treasure trove of letters exposing the oddest duo since tom and jerry - william hanna and george orwell. they met in the lobby of the hotel du jeu de paume in paris while orwell was doing research for "down and out in london and paris," which put hanna off soup for the rest of his life, says hanna's granddaughter susan swamu . orwell was charmed by hanna, who was fascinated by the world of the future. they sparred over predictions. surely you jest, says orwell in one characteristically dark letter. even if they someday make sprockets, workers will never be able to survive on the wages from such an industry. listen my young friend, orwell says in another missive, shopping on a computerized communication device would be all well and good, but surely with the use of such a miracle machine, the government will find a way to monitor every move of its pacified citizens.   in some of his most prescient writing ever, orwell tells hanna, knowing you, you'll write a story of the future that will far outstrip my lowly scribbles. do me a favor, though, my friend, at least put a secret government listening device on the family dog's collar.
