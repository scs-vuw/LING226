scottsdale, arizona. plastic surgeon dr. michael pope is facing three malpractice suits for accidentally injecting three people, one woman and two men, with an enzyme called cardolazium, which is a sulfite extract that is made from shrimp feces.  the plaintiffs were in the office of dr. pope for standard botox injections when the error occurred. mr. alan greer, one of the three plaintiffs, was rushed to an emergency room in the nearby suburb of chandler, arizona, when he went into a state of allergic anaphylaxis. it turns out the anaphylaxis was not from the shellfish toxin but from an allergy to cat dander because the man had gone home after his injection, and he had fallen asleep on his couch, at which time his neighbor's cats came into his apartment and licked him all around the mouth.
