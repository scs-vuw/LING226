on a recent wednesday in the british midlands city of birmingham, an ordinary citizen passed by the downtown branch of natwest bank and noticed employees cowering beneath their desks. naturally, the passerby alerted the police. and officers were on the scene in minutes, only to learn that the employees weren't under siege. they were playing hide-and-seek as a team-building exercise.  the bank was embarrassed. the police simply laughed. and life returned to normal. a funny incident that, for one brief moment, made people forget that, in 30 years, earth will be uninhabitable.
