houston entrepreneur paul johnson is tackling the twin crises of energy and obesity with eco-fit, an eco friendly gym. the hallmark? treadmills powered by people. while one person jogs off the pounds, two others get a lighter workout on a seesaw, pumping clean energy to the treadmill. at a slow pace, it all works beautifully. but as the treadmill moves faster, it requires more pounds of seesaw pressure, many more pounds. for instance, for the treadmill to move at a brisk 15 miles per hour, it requires 520 pounds of seesaw weight, roughly two poseidon adventure-sized shelley winters.  to keep up the pace, management has to fuel the seesaw sitters with a constant supply of yodels and soda. as the runners have gotten thinner, the seesaw sitters have gotten fatter, and tension between the two camps has increased. "faster," yell the sitters to the runners. "fatter" shout back the runners. "i wanted to do something good," said johnson, "and now my gym is being torn apart by ergonomic apartheid."
