from the oklahoma daily, parents liz and wilson wainwright  are proud to announce the wedding of their daughter alyssa wainwright , unfairly snubbed gymnast from the 2008 olympic trials, winner of gold medal in balance beam and uneven parallel bar at oklahoma state championship in 2007, member of ncaa silver medal-winning gymnastics team at oklahoma state, where she was on full athletic scholarship after graduating...   ...from the distinguished tate high school with a 3.9 gpa...   ...while simultaneously graduating from libertyville gymnastics academy as a gold medal-winner in three of four disciplines. her groom, luis camacho , is a 6 foot, 189 pound quarterback with a 4.240 time and 38-inch vertical leap...   ...who is now playing for the arena football league's washington valor after a career with the cfl saskatchewan roughriders and a brief stint with the nfl detroit lions, who cut him as if they could do better.   i mean, the lions? really? luis was drafted by the lions after three years at oklahoma state, where he probably should have stayed one more year and moved up to the first round, which would have been more guaranteed money. meanwhile, the lions went 4 and 12 right after cutting him...   ...so it looks like they'll be missing the playoffs and the wedding. we wish the couple love, happiness and an injury-free future in coaching once their playing careers have ended.
