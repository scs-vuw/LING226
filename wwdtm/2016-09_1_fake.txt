tomas gudmanstater , the mayor of the rural hamlet of grindavik, iceland, wanted to build a small business park at the edge of town to attract business and boost the economy. but there was one powerful local special interest he forgot to consider - elves. over half of all icelanders believe in what they call hoodoo folk, or hidden people, living inside the rocks and trees of their island nation. elves in iceland are kind of like the letter j in the word fjord, silently hiding but everyone just sort of knows that they're there. and the residents of grindavik believe the - an entire community of these elves lives in the five acres of ancient volcanic rock that the mayor wanted to demolish to clear the way for his business park. so this week, grindavickers  took to the streets, marching through town, chanting three, six, nine, 12, don't destroy the homes of elves. in public, the mayor said he respected his fellow residents' position and promised to work to find the solution. but later that night, after a few too many whatever people from iceland drink to get drunk, he went on an extended tirade that was secretly recorded by one of his elf-loving aides and leaked to the press. in it, the mayor criticized the townsfolk as, quote, "backwoods rubes who cling to their elves and magic," and he claimed the whole town was in the pocket of something he called the big elf lobby. the next day, he claimed his remarks were taken out of context, which is hard to believe within its sustained 15-minute rant, and apologized to his townfolk saying, i didn't mean to disparage all elves. some of them, i assume, are good elves.
