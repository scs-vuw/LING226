this year's macy's parade came off without a hitch. santa didn't get anyone pregnant and none of the giant balloons broke free and smashed into buildings or got anyone pregnant.  so, this week, nbc revealed that the parade was a little too good to be true. when they lost their satellite feed in the middle of the salute to broadway last week, the network cut to footage of last year's parade. vivian rose, a rockette, out on maternity leave, outed the network when she saw herself dancing on a float, only she was in a hospital on thanksgiving day. director of live events, barry bruder, has admitted the lapse and apologized. "we had a little panic in the control room," he said, "and we threw in ten minutes of old footage. i don't think of it as fraud, more like a classic rerun."
