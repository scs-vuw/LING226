have you ever had that strange feeling that somebody's watching you? and what if you were right, and on top of that, details of your daily life were being documented and posted online? that is what happened to brad and kim keywell  from chicago. they were victims of a website called rearwindow.com, part of a creepy, cult craze called rear-windowing. this is where a person/weirdo uses a high-powered telescope to pick unsuspecting victims and observe them on their daily goings-on. kim keywell said she found out about rearwindow.com from her daughter, jessica, whose friends kept asking her if her dad's back is really as hairy as a wild alpaca. when she finally went the site, she found over 120 posts about her family's life. i thought i was going to be horrified, but i went through it, and it was actually kind of sweet. and now that we know someone is watching us, we've closed the blinds, put up a note that said thanks, and now brad has started waxing his back.
