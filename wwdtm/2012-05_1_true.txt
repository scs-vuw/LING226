the people behind "magic: the gathering" have spent a few years trying to find new frontiers of nerdery to which they can bring the youth of america, and they've come up with an idea for all dweebs, an adventure card game, starring the heroes of classic literature. each character, in what is going to be called the dark library, will be possessed of all the qualities developed for them by their original creators, plus a character-specific superpower bestowed by the makers of the game. for example: queequeg, tashtego and daggoo, the three harpooners from "moby dick" will each get you 125 marksmanship points. while montresor, the dark villain of edgar allen poe's, "the cask of amontillado," will carry with him 50 brooding points, capable of being overcome only by a greater number of optimism prime points, such as the combined one thousand op points possessed by the bennet sisters from "pride and prejudice."  : there will also be a special gold edged mr. darcy card, of which on five hundred will be made, that trumps every jane austen character, except emma woodhouse, whose archery skills will lay him low.  :"this is a field we've been itching to get into," said martha willows gausman, the company's director of marketing. "the number of possibilities are absolutely limitless. and now that zombies have made jane austen cool again, the youth market is wide open."
