tween age girls think they are just expressing disdain toward their parents and grody boys. they are, in fact, playing a potentially deadly game of, quote, "ocular roulette." that is the message that dr. diana vermeer of the american vision institute would like to get through to these girls, if they would just listen for a minute and stop rolling their eyes.  :"eye rolling," says dr. vermeer, "has become epidemic among girls 11 to 15." and now we know that eyes rolled too forcefully and often can stick that way. yes, they can.  :"hundreds of cases of stuck-up eyes are reported daily in the u.s. alone," she says. "it was one thing when eye rolling was a natural, if deeply irritating response to parents' very existence. that, believe me, i can understand. i was a girl once too, you know." "but now, eye rolling has become a mean. girls practice it together. they push each other to extremes. and we see the tragic consequences in ophthalmologists' offices everywhere." dr. vermeer cites the influence of the tv show "icarly" in which...  :...tween girls roll their eyes repeatedly to canned laughter. "i have a daughter of my own," says dr. vermeer, "and when i try to tell her about the risk she's running, well - oh my god, did i just roll my eyes?"
