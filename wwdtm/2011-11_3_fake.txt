"i was on facebook one day and this thing pops up, suggesting i follow spongebob squarepants. i thought, hey, we're spongebob squarepants. i contacted legal, and guess what, it's a kid's name." spongebob squarepants is, in fact, a 12-year-old. "my real friends call me robert," says spongebob.  : but my real name is spongebob squarepants. spongebob squarepants smith's mother loved the popular animated character, and frustrated by the common last name smith, wanted to give her son a moniker that would really stand out. "he's a great kid," says nickelodeon's ellis. "when we found out about him, we couldn't resist doing something for him. i mean, imagine weathering the storm of that name." "they sent me sheets and tub toys," says spongebob. "i sent them back. my name is spongebob squarepants smith. i don't laugh like that dude. i don't even like that show that much. i don't even like the beach that much. i am not yellow. i'm not a sponge. people can't do dishes with me."  : "i told them i wanted them to donate science books to my school. they were cool about it. it's been a hard name to have, but my bother jiggly puff has had it worse."
