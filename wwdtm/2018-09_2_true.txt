bexhill-on-sea - lovely little english coastal village, and has a lovely little problem. bexhill's overrun with bexhills . a bexhill, in local sussex dialect, is a european dormouse - wee creatures resembling mice, except with furry tails, great big eyes and a soft, fluffy coat. they're the most adorable creatures you've ever seen. but lately, perhaps due to climate change, the little darlings have been breeding like the dickens. bexhill is infested with an estimated 900,000 bexhills. now what dormice do is be dormant. they curl up in a sweet little ball of fur, and they go to sleep. and they're doing it everywhere in bexhill-on-sea. but they're just so precious that, in this nation of animal lovers, no one has the heart to disturb them. too cute to shoot, as one local person...   ...put it. fortunately for the citizens of bexhill, brexit hasn't happened yet. the eu commission is sending in a special team from slovenia to deal with the problem. it's a team of slovenian chefs because in slovenia, the dormouse is considered a delicacy
