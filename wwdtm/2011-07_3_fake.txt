people always look a little strange in their driver's license photos. their eyes are closed, their smile is too broad. but mr. nico alm of austria looks a bit off in his photo because he's wearing a pasta strainer on his head.  mr. alm isn't donning this comical headgear because he showed up at the dmv after a night of wild, yet efficient, austrian debauchery.  he's doing it for his faith. a recent austrian law states headwear is only allowed in official documents for religious reasons. so mr. alm lightheartedly told officials he wanted to wear the pasta strainer for his photo because he is a devout and committed member of the church of the flying spaghetti monster, who refer to themselves as pastafarians.  austrian officials, never ones to pass up an opportunity to not get a joke, have allowed his driver's license photo to stand. now mr. alm wants pastafarianism to become an officially recognized faith in austria. and, judging by austria's history of tolerating different religions, he should be just fine.
