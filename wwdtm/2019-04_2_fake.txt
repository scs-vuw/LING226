the millionaires and billionaires in palm beach are used to getting anything they want. but on this exclusive florida island, the one thing they can't find is parking. the shortage of public spaces has been a problem for years. but things came to a head last november when elise flagger , a descendant of the island's founder, and susie herman , third wife of a hedge fund billionaire, got into a fight on tony worth  avenue. elise pulled the front of her rolls into an open space just as susie backed her jag into the same space, and neither would budge. the ensuing brouhaha resulted in disorderly conduct arrests for both women...  ...and a new law passed last month, reports the palm beach daily news. city officials debated various solutions but finally settled on this - if two cars arrive at the same spot at the same time, the older driver gets the space...   ...if and only if he or she produces their driver's license as proof of age. but the real genius of this is that they know any self-respecting trophy wife will drive away before ever revealing their real age.   as of march 31, there have been no further incidents.
