if you've ever been to morocco, you know its people are warm and generous, eager to lend you the tagine off their back. you can sit for hours in a moroccan cafe nursing mint tea and sharing stories. just don't share newspapers because that act of civility is now a civil offense. in an attempt to bolster the print industry, the country's communication minister has banned the lending and free provision of newspapers in all cafes. the moroccan federation of newspaper editors claims it has, quote, "lost approximately $150 million per year due to the population's access to newspapers that are left behind in public places." minister mustafa khalfi says publishers are suffering from the unscrupulous charitableness of moroccans. so he has forbidden the papers from being like westerners, wantonly spread open, just waiting for anyone to pick them up.  cafes may now post baristas to spring pop quizzes on empty-handed customers. those who display a knowledge of half-day-old news could have their fingers inspected for ink.
