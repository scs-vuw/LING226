on january 17 of next year, canadians will roll out a new holiday. and if you don't like it - well, you're just going to have to deal with it, buddy, because january 17 is canada's first ever national stop apologizing day.   the holiday was the brainchild of todd mccullough  of kamloops after an incident he was involved in at a tim hortons in 2015.   while i was reaching for the coffee, mccullough told the vancouver sun, and this other fellow was reaching for the timbits doughnut holes, and - well, we did that thing where we both kept reaching and then standing back and apologizing and then reaching and then standing back and apologizing. and so about two hours went by like that...   and i realized, we canadians - we've got a dang problem with apologizing too much. sorry for the coarse language, he added.   america's notoriously polite and, let's be honest, superior in every way neighbors to the north have always been quick to apologize whether or not it was warranted. the city of thunder bay, ontario, once apologized to duluth, minn., for the icy winds coming off of lake superior...  ...saying they felt they could have, quote, "done more to warm it up on its way south..."   ...but never again - or, at least, not on january 17. mccullough had tried for years to generate attention for the proposal via the internet with little success. but the idea really picked up steam when cbc news anchor dan ratner , who's sort of the canadian version of - you guessed it - tom brokaw...   ...picked up the cause. for 30 years, ratner's sign-off at the end of each newscast was, so there's the news in canada. sorry some of it was pretty grim. of course, ratner had no idea what grim was until he started looking at the u.s. headlines post-2016.   and that's when he had an epiphany, which was that, based on america's behavior just in the last two years, canadians have nothing to apologize for until 2079.
