runner, world record holder and two-time olympic gold medalist in the 800- meter track event, david rashida  spent the fourth of july at a youth track and field event and barbecue in ames, iowa - or at least the crowd of 3,000 athletes, fans, carnivores and revelers thought he did. the kenyan acted as the official starter of the 800-meter race at the iowa event. he graciously signed autographs, displayed his medals, shook hands with fans and gave a brilliant and inspirational speech to the young athletes, which included such memorable quotes as, believe in yourself, and you can be whoever you want to be.   when a fan ignored mr. rashida's polite request to refrain from taking photographs, however, the scene turned ugly fast. rashida angrily waded through the crowd, grabbed the phone, threw it and began to run. a pregnant, off-duty officer, b.j. nebesky , gave chase of about 200 meters, gained on rashida's 50-meter lead and caught him.   that was their first clue.   they'd been had. this guy ate barbecue faster than he ran.   we paid this guy $2,000 to appear here, and he probably cost us another $2,000 in the side of beef and keg of beer he consumed, lamented event producer blake zingerman . i did notice he had a kind of belly on him, but i assumed he put that weight on while he was here. i'll tell you what - we've got norma rae coming on labor day, and i'm going to want to check over her papers carefully.
