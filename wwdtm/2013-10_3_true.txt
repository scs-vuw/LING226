any woman who's worn manolo blahnik shoes knows that they are sexy. but did you know that those high-heeled, expensive beauties featured so lovingly on "sex and the city" can also be used as lethal weapons? inspired by the episode where carrie gets mugged in soho, and the guy takes her blahniks, tone rodriguez opened up his own self-defense class for ladies in south beach, miami, called blahniks kicks. using martial arts techniques he learned as a black belt in , rodriguez teaches women how to take off the blahniks at one fell swoop and be armed within seconds. tone was quoted as saying, "the next time someone tells you give me your blahniks, all you have to do is say my pleasure then take them off and proceed to beat the crap out of them."  student malorie hampton explains how at blahnik kicks, they're taught to only use their moves as a last resort, never start a fight but always finish it. rodriguez says that "sex and the city" wasn't his only inspiration. when i was a child, my mother used to beat me with her shoes.  sometimes even twice a day. i mean, i was a bad kid, so i kind of deserved it. later when i was teaching self-defense, i realized the shoes and particularly blahniks could serve as a great weapon, sexy going into the clubs, bad-ass coming out.
