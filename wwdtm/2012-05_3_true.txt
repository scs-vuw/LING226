henry david thoreau was not a high tech guy. "we do not ride on the railroad," he wrote, "it rides on us." so we can guess what he would say about angry birds.  : but what would he say about walden: the video game? a century and a half or so ago, thoreau wrote of immersing himself in, like, actual nature in the, like, actual woods near walden, like, actual pond.  : now, from the university of southern california's game innovation lab comes a virtual version of thoreau's, like, experiences. "the game starts, as does the book," says usc professor tracy fullerton, "with the building of the cabin. it takes place in both the woods and in a section of concord, mass."  : of course, you don't have to actually build anything or hang out with squirrels to read the book either. so, is thoreau jumping up and down in his grave? maybe someone will come out with a game called angry bards.
