as a couple, jacob siegel wasserman and lauren wells heffernan seemed to have it all: good jobs, good educations, the right kind of families. and so it seemed only natural that when they decided to get married the new york times got wind, and featured them in its "vows" section. things started to crumble, though, for the siegel wasserman-wells heffernans.  : they both took each other's names while keeping their own - when the times' factchecking interns started making some calls. jacob, it turned out, had not graduated top of his class at harvard, as he'd always told people, but rather had finished decidedly in the middle of the graduating class of the cambridge bartending school class of '97. meanwhile, lauren's family, it turned out, hadn't made its money from her father's work on early versions of the jarvic heart, but rather his invention of the sham-wow, absorbent cloth.  : quite accidentally, it turned out, while trying to clean up spilled beer at the family's trailer home in sandusky.  : upon the paper's publication and seeing the mistruths exposed by the times' fact checking, jacob and lauren quickly realized they were not so much in love with each other as the idea of each other and promptly split.
