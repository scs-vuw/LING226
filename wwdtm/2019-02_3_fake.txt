is there anything better than a mother's love? one maryland mom certainly think so. she wants an actual lover's love for her son. the woman's name is unknown, but she was spotted on towson university's campus desperately trying to find her son a date. the baltimore sun - which is a newspaper, not her actual son...  ...reported this week that a woman in her 50s was approaching people and showing them photos of her baby boy all grown up and asking them to date him.   chief charles herring said her reported behavior may cause concern. he did not specify to whom it would cause concern, but it's widely assumed he meant her absolute virgin of a child.   university officials say that the woman is not being sought for any criminal investigation. but they do want her to refrain from hustling her son's photo around campus - even if it does have that cute puppy instagram filter.
