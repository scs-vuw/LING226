if there's ever been someone with a feel for mice, it's shiva mcneese of kenosha, wis. as a girl, she discovered she could go into a home plagued by mice and sense where the little fellows were hiding and lead them out. at first, she performed this service for friends for free. then she began to charge and expand, but she always said she did not seek fame. she did not want her business to scale. however, she reckoned without a squeak of a mouth.   for the last year or so, we learned this week, shiva has been followed by mice wherever she go. the profile of shiva that appeared in the kenosha sun bulletin this week was far from flattering. the mouse whisperer, said the headline, has become a loud mouth. it caught her standing on a downtown street corner surrounded by mice and screaming, go away, mice. a neighbor was quoted as saying, "she knows what mice want, all right." unfortunately, it's her.
