over the years, many useless products that nobody wants have been introduced at the consumer electronics show, like fitness trackers, green energy innovations and, of course, the smart phone itself. and now a brilliant innovator is using technology to forever change the way we hold up our pants. i bring you belty, the so-called smart belt. the concept behind belty is complex and futuristic. the buckle and corresponding strap either expands or contracts depending on how much food you've consumed and how much exercise you've done. before belty, americans simply had to suffer with synch-like apparatus holding up their pants. and as they get fatter, people molded themselves into sausage shapes until they eventually exploded.  belty grows as you grow. it's almost encouraging you to gorge yourself, sitting there around your gut, saying eat, papa, eat.
