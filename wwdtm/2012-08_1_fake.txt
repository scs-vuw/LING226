facebook and cat videos may save your life. people in tech support call centers are starting to actually die from boredom.  : one minute they're sitting in their cubbies staring at monitors, reading scripts into their headsets. "is your computer plugged in? is it turned on?"  : the next, bam, dead on their keyboards.  : after investigating several of these mysterious deaths in call centers from minot to el paso, forensics expert dr. gordon hayward has determined that extreme, paralyzing boredom, such as that found in particular work environments, reduces mental activity to less than 10 percent of the 10 percent of our brains that we use in the first place.  : this can cause the brain to go into a passive meta state, similar to that achieved by most advanced yogis during their meditations.  :"yogis, however, aren't generally staring into a flickering monitor while wearing a headset," said dr. gordon. "the combination of brain stasis and the dynamo hum of technology can cause the brain to essentially switch off." gordon encourages office workers to frequently check their facebook pages, join online gambling clubs, and download world of minecraft 2.3 for good measure.
