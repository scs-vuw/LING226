while reading to his great-granddaughter, paris may wynette, 77-year-old herbert wynette got an awful shock. i picked up a big book of stories. i read one about different colored fish, i think it was. and i caught sight of the author's name. it was a collection of stories by a fellow named dr. seuss. and there was a picture of him on the inside flap and a little bio saying his real name was theodore geisel. well, that little so-and-so, i said right out loud. he gave me a medical exam.  wynette had been at a party in la jolla in 1985 and was introduced to dr. seuss by the name dr. seuss. naturally, i thought he was a doctor. and i had been feeling quite poorly. so after we'd had a few drinks, i mentioned this to him.  and right there at the party, he palpitated my liver, says wynette.  geisel has been deceased since 1991, but his wife audrey geisel confirms the story. theodore was a bit tipsy, and we weren't, at first, sure if mr. wynettewasn't pulling his leg. i mean, dr. seuss was quite a famous name as a children's author. he looked in my ear with a light, says the still incredulous wynette. he said he saw a who.  i thought it was a type of infection.
