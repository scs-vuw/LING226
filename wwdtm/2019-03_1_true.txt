after years of being the last rider over the finish line atop a racehorse ironically named last word , alexander fauvel  was on the verge of never riding last word again when he stopped by to visit the horse while eating a pickle and discovered that the horse had an extreme reaction to the pickle. fauvel got an idea. he mounted the horse, took him out to the track and showed him the pickle. last word took off like a rocket. we've been winning ever since, said fauvel. we get on that inside rail, i squeeze the reins in my right hand and the pickle in my left. then i reach my pickle hand in front of his muzzle, and it's equine magic.   to date, no other horse has reacted to pickles the way last word does. undaunted, in training sessions, desperate jockeys wave any vegetable they can think of...   ...in their horse's face looking for a burst of speed - eggplants, tubers, brussels sprouts. so far, nothing. some horses actually back up when they see kale.
