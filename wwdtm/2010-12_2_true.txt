ho, ho, no. sometimes santa gets a bad case of the grouchies. case in point: tthe sad, sad story of martin mcmillan, a department store santa claus at the huge macy's store in downtown dallas. the elements for a perfect storm of holiday hell were all there: an overheated department store, a line of squirmy children, and the free candy canes that some kids quickly licked down into sharp sword-like points.  when little jeannie shepherd sat on santa's lap and tugged his beard to see if it was real, santa blew a gasket. while he was trying to displace the child from his seat, she jammed her candy cane into what the police later referred to as his lap area.  santa has filed a workman's comp claim and has sued the department store for maintaining an unsafe working environment, claiming that his lap is his special workspace.
