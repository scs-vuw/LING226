as a travel writer, he's used to freebies and therefore was shocked, as he tried to check out of the hotel, to receive a bill for $13,000. crucis was detained by local police when he refused to pay. two days and one u.s. embassy official later, he found out that the chinese believed he was really tom cruise, and that tofun was actually their way of saying "top gun."  anyway, the villagers were deeply offended that a rich american movie star would repay their hospitality by trying to take advantage of them. the bill was finally settled, and crucis admitted he should have questioned the excessive generosity. but he's still baffled about the mistaken id. i look a little like cruise, he admitted to reuters, but i'm a lot taller.
