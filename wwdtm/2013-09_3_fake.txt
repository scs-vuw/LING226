i love you, you love me, right this way to cell block c. don't be surprised to hear that asahikawa prison, japan's only prison with a mascot. the cuddly 6'6" mascot named katakurichan has a big square face, an enormous purple flower for hair and wears a warden's uniform, adorbs. quote, "prisons have this image of being isolated places surrounded by imposing gray walls," says one of the prison's publicists. "and people tend to consider them unwelcome in their neighborhood." well, this mascot is already making a difference. at the prison's annual fair - and doesn't every prison have an annual fair - katakurichan was a huge hit with kids and cons. the town hopes to make its prison a place you'll want to get into.
