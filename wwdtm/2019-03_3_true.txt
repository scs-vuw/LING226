when a perth, australia, man, through great fault of his own, managed to glue his own butt to a six-foot wooden bar counter last friday night...   ...he did what any of us would do. he sat there.   then he posted his predicament on reddit, which has saved so many lives.   so i'm kind of sitting here with a slab of jarrah attached to my butt cheeks watching "battlestar galactica" and waiting for the emergency services to return my call. after realizing the only chemicals he owned capable of divorcing his cheeks from his board were tucked away in the garage through a door he couldn't fit through, he turned back to his reddit feed to find 300 comments, one more useless than the next, until one jumped out at him. omg - what a pickle. yes, cried perth's sticky butt man. he'd read somewhere on the google that the vinegar in pickle juice will break down an epoxy bond, and he had a jar of gherkins within his reach. one episode of "battlestar galactica" later, the perth pickle butt posted that he was free. saturday morning, the man reported feeling a little tenderness but not much pain. if anything, my butt feels thoroughly exfoliated.   all right. here are your choices, amy. from paula poundstone, the horse that would only run faster - could win races but only with the incentive of a pickle. faith, a woman makes an emotional journey only with the help of an emotional support pickle. and from tom bodett, a man who had accidentally super-glued his own butt to a countertop escaping by using the miracle of pickle juice. which of these is the real story about a pickle coming to the rescue?
