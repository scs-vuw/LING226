"the star-spangled banner" is famous for being spectacularly botched in public. luminaries from christina aguilera to roseanne barr have delivered famously flubbed versions of our national anthem. but not everyone lets a tangle with the patriotic tune keep them down. at a little league game in sanders creek, ohio, city councilman jeff mccrory  mumbled out a mangled rendition of the song, which included re-imagined lines such as all the bad parts we watched and twilight's last feeding. i'd say he only got about 12 percent of the words right, reported one spectator. through the perriest  flight. what does that even mean? councilman mcgrory was mortified. and after repeated requests to redeem himself and repeated rejections, he decided to take matters into his own hands. at a playoff game on sunday, just as the anthem was about to be sung by a local church choir member, loud feedback could be heard near third base. it was the councilman who was wearing a headset microphone and lifting a boom box over his head, a la john cusack in "say anything," while belting out the national anthem. he had clearly studied up and nailed every single word with some of it even in tune. all appeared forgiven until the end when mccrory went for a grand finale. while crooning and the home of the brave, he launched a bottle rocket that unfortunately careened into the american flag, which promptly caught on fire.   and fell into the stands. no one was injured, but the game had to be canceled. officials expect the next little league game in sanders creek to be over capacity as everyone wants to know how mccrory will screw it up next.
