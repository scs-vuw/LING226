barack obama and john boehner are pals. i mean, well, what would one be without the other? it's obviously a buddy act like dean martin and jerry lewis, although i'll leave it to the listeners to decide which is which. anyway, they plan it all out ahead of time. barack will do something that angers john and makes obama look good to liberals. then john will have a snappy comeback that angers barack and makes boehner look good to conservatives. and then they go off and have a cigarette and a good laugh. and, you know, i've actually never talked about about this before. the reason i know that they're friends is an old buddy of mine happens to be a caddy at burning bush where the two play golf. now golf, of course, is the main bond between obama and boehner, but my caddy friend says that they also talk about, of all things, rap music. he says that this is the only time that boehner and obama actually argue. the president's a tupac guy. the speaker likes biggie smalls. so if you're ever wondering, you know, if that hyper partisanship in washington is just a put up job, the answer's no, not when it comes to tupac and biggie.
