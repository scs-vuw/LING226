walton wild office products in algoma, wisconsin had been in the paper shredding business for 60 years. ever since founder bob walt had invented his revolutionary new feed mechanism, their machines were the pride and joy of the town. the algoma high school football team is called the shredders. but now, with more and more of the business being done without any paper to shred, the demand for w & w shredders have plummeted and the company is in danger of collapsing and with it the whole town. but engineers found a solution in the company's past. "old bob walt started out working the grinder at his father's butcher shop," recalled bill weishopple, the president of walton wild. "it was there that he first thought up the idea for his feed mechanism." so the company took their inventory of unsold paper shredders, put them in boxes labeled "artisanal meat grinders and salami slicers."  they started demonstrating the machines at organic restaurants and groceries all across the country and sales have been through the roof. one place in green point, brooklyn keeps its machine running 24/7 making a specialty, organic beef confetti tartare.  and for the vegetarians out there, the company is also offering state of the art lettuce shredders.
