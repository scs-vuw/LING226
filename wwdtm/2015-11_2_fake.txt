like many of us, homewood, ill., native jill benjamin  loves going to horror movies. and, like many of us, jill loves screaming with terrified glee during horror movies. but unlike many of us, jill's screams are more of the bloodcurdling, oh, my god, is somebody actually getting stabbed in this theater variety. so this halloween, after years of complaints from other audience members, her local movie house laid down the law and banned jill from their theater. ann seelo's country club hill 16  manager jack henson  claims he had no choice. she was so loud that people couldn't hear the sound of the movie, henson told the chicago tribune. so people got really scared, he added. one time, an old woman four rows behind her called 911 'cause she was convinced someone was giving birth in the theater.  local teenager and horror fan kara korso  agreed with the decision. i sat behind that lady once. i thought she was literally possessed by the devil or something. also, i heard her say she had seen the movie before, so she knew it was coming and she was still screaming her head off. exiled from her local multiplex, jill searched for another theater that would take her in, but was shut out of every theater in a 50 mile radius, until a small art house theater nearby, park forest, got a brilliant idea. this week, they unveiled their special jill benjamin scream queen marathon of new and classic horror movies featuring jill and her terrifying scream, front and center, at every single showing. and the reviews are in. she's awesome, said 15-year-old cassidy zmoda . it's like a whole new definition of surround sound. i think i might have some minor ear drum damage, but it was totally worth it.
