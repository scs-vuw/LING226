"we'll be sawing; we'll be splitting," the hostess purred. "we'll be stacking and we'll be burning." thus begins norway's recent blockbuster tv broadcast, "national firewood night."  twelve hours of norwegians sawing, splitting, stacking and burning firewood.  but wait, it's even more exciting than it sounds. the first four hours is action packed with norwegians in parkas chopping wood. then for eight suspenseful hours, the camera stays on a close-up of the wood burning in the fireplace.  for eight hours.  quote, "i couldn't go to bed because i was so excited," one viewer wrote, after the premier. "when will they add new logs?"  a full fifth of norway's population tuned into the premier. of course, it wouldn't be a hit without some controversy. quote, "50 percent complained that the bark was facing up, and the rest complained that the bark was facing down," said lars metting, the author whose best seller on chopping, drying and stacking wood was the basis of the tv show. "one thing that really divides norway is bark."
