cleveland native crystal o'connor had her hands full when she got a new job as the managing editor and publisher of the guinness gazette in dublin, ireland. like all newspapers, it's been struggling with circulation and ad sales, and she needed a way to increase the interest of the paper. but like everybody in america and no one who actually lived in ireland, o'connor knows about leprechauns and the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  so she announced the great leprechaun treasure giveaway with clues buried in each edition of the paper, which can only be seen through special glasses, 2 euros each. people went nuts. thousands of glasses were sold, as well as many extra issues of the paper. dubliners scanned for clues, solved puzzles and then last sunday discovered a crate berry  in a suburban backyard. the lucky finder of the leprechaun's treasure opened the crate to find three week's worth of back issues of the gazette and a plaque reading the true treasure is knowledge.  the drunk riots that followed destroyed the offices of the guinness gazette.  and the police say that the newspaper bonfire that burned all night was visible 20 kilometers away. however, the insurance payoff on the building - the newspaper is now back in the black. plus, ms. o'connor says, they had to buy those newspapers to burn them. so in the end, it worked.
