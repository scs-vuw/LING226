many residents of dubai struggle to find uses for their money and, more importantly, uses for their money that highlight the fact that they have so much. the peacock company is there to help. peacocks are to the peacock company what electric scooters are to the bird company. like the scooter users, peacock users can use the peacock app to find where there is a peacock to rent nearest them.   and the company provides thousands. or they may just trip over one on the street and use their app to pay to rent it. the peacocks are tethered to docks that have been installed throughout the city of the overly indulged. why rent a peacock? because you can. and people do. a peacock fanning its glorious tail feathers is like the user fanning out a fat stack of cash. it's a status symbol that poops.   peacocks are also noisy. the burden is most noticeable in elevators. dubai prides itself on high-rise buildings, and peacock renters have discovered that the birds are afraid of heights. peacocks fly, but they don't go very high. and on an elevator, they pass out at about the sixth floor...  ...but not before they lose their lunch at the fifth.
