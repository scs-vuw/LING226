stockholm has a tourism problem. research shows that foreigners think of swedes as cold and aloof. worse, actual walking around and trying to talk to people proves they're right.   so if you can't provide nice people, fake them. hologram hospitality is a program now being tested that projects holograms of nice people in popular tourist spots.   the holograms might say hello or have a nice day or, using an internet connection, even comment on the weather. harold samms,  the official commissioned to run the program, says, quote, "we tried to offer people on the street free lessons in polite conversation, but no one would talk to us. so it turned out to be easier just to invent nice people." but early tests revealed a problem. the holograms were too nice. say, what a sunny day, and tourists just grunt and walk by. according to samms, we had to make them a little ruder just to seem human. now a hologram might react to it tourists walking by by saying, hey, i'm standing here. you blind?   people instantly turn to argue back and then engage with the hologram. if you try to reach your hand through a hologram, it might say, hey pal, buy me dinner first.   no matter what the hologram says, it usually leaves them happy or freaked out, in which case they go to a bar and spend money, which is the whole idea.
