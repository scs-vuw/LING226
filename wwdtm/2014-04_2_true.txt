cupid and their mutual interest in sea elephants brought susan winter and neil mauer together with a little help from susan's coworker at the san diego public library. naturally, they headed to the eharmony of the sea elephant world, phillips beach, sea elephant rookery, where mating season was in full swing. we both felt it right away, says mauer, the sexual energy was amazing. susan looked at me and i looked at her and we were like, let's go for it. it's not like we're weird or anything, it's just sea elephants - the beach, the pounding of the surf - and honestly, i might have been a little drunk. but if we'd been with a flock of pigeons having sex or goats or something, i don't think we'd have done it. it's just there's something about sea elephants. so there on the sand, go for it they did. until susan happened to look up and see a highly agitated alpha-male sea elephant moving its enormous, blubbery mass across the sand towards them at a surprising and alarming speed. at first, calling upon his extensive knowledge of sea elephant behavior, mauer suggested they lay dormant and submissive. it worked it to a point, says winter. the male lost interest in neil as a threat right away, but then i realized he thought he had won me in the standoff. neil then tried to mimic challenging sea elephant behavior, putting his elbow on his head, dropping his fist vertically over his nose to look like a male proboscis, and vocalizing and lunging. but i could see the look on that sea elephant's face. he wanted me in his harem. finally, i just yelled, forget about science - run to the car. the couple made their way up a rock face to mauer's 1965 mustang, eluding the randy dumbo of the sea, and once again proving the scientific theorem - the guy with the nice car gets the girl.
