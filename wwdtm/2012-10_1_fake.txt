most people go to expedia.com to book their vacations, maybe even travelocity. but soon there might be a new site for adventure tourists called getkidnappedbyabedouin.com.  : that's right; bedouin's in the sinai peninsula have been kidnapping tourists to hold them for ransom against the government of egypt. their demands have been to get fellow bedouins released. however, whether the government complied or not these kidnappers have been showing their victims a good time. one tribal leader, sheikh admed hashem was quoted as saying, "it isn't just kidnapping, it is a tourist safari."  : and the victims agree. norma supe, a 63-year-old nurse from california, who was kidnapped in february, told the ap, "all of this is an unforgettable memory."  : supe was kidnapped with another member of her group, 66-year-old patti esperanza. this tourist safari was so irresistible that their guide, hisham zaki even volunteered to go along as a translator. as zaki later recalled, esperanza demanded that one of her kidnappers stop smoking. "i told her, are you joking? you are kidnapped."  : but the bedouin kidnapper cooperated, throwing his cigarette out the car window. at one point, esperanza recounted, the kidnappers stopped to prepare coffee for the women but upon learning that esperanza does not drink coffee, they made her tea.
