brian burkstein  of lexington, ky., was as proud as any father of the bride could be, which is why, for his wedding gift, he wanted to surprise her with something truly special and unexpected. and it was indeed the last thing ellie and her new husband mark expected when they walked into their wedding reception and discovered that instead of the band they had hired after months of research, the evening's musical entertainment would be provided by her father and his acapella group from college. brian had corralled the members of the group, cleverly titled melodious thunk, and called the real band to cancel the week before. so guests expecting to hear wedding standards like kool and the gang's "celebration" were instead treated to acappella classics like bobby mcferrin's "don't worry be happy." i kept waiting for the real band to show up, said one partygoer who wished to remain anonymous to protect her anonymity, but then my dad and his friends just kept whacking their chest and making clicking noises. i was mortified. burkstein never expected his daughter to have such a negative reaction. as he told the lexington herald later, when ellie was a kid, she loved listening to our old melodious thunk cds. she loved "no instruments required," our album of phil collins covers, "funk 182," our blink 182 tribute and "ja-capella," our all reggae album. no word yet on where the happy couple is honeymooning or whether they will ever come back.
