most parents will tell you that kids are one of the best things in life. they will also tell you that kids are the worst thing for your love life. that's what inspired former special ops commander, mike delea, to start a service called make love, not war.  under this service, former military special ops soldiers come to your house and do whatever it takes to give you and your spouse time to make love.  whether it's putting the kids down for a nap, challenging your teenager to a game of one-on-one basketball or using tranquilizer darts, these soldiers will keep the kids busy while you're in the trenches.   delea uses standard decoy techniques learned in the military to keep the kids at bay while the parents play. dealing with a baby is the easiest. they're so dumb, you can trick them with a baby rattle.  one time, i just shook the rattle for 10 minutes until the parents were done, and the mission was accomplished.  jenny tripoli, mother of five, who used make love, not war, says it saved her marriage. my husband and i were so stressed for time with the kids, that our marriage was on the brink. i thought these guys were heroes before, but now i can't live without them. we live by mike's motto - making love is like being in the special forces. you got to be ready to go any time, any place.
