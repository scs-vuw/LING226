a pork loin to protect your groin.  after a dismal season, the northumberland pumas of the british american football association lost their official sponsor. without the additional funding, they couldn't afford to upgrade their equipment. that's when quarterback john burridge, the son of a nearby pig farmer, was struck with inspiration. pigskin pads. if you've ever had a stale pork rind, you know how tough they are to chew. when aged properly, the pigskin make excellent athletic supporters. they're more flexible than regular pads and can withstand more impact, burridge says. they absorb sweat, contour nicely to the human form, and after a long sweaty game can even give off a nice mesquite aroma.
