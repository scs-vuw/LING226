from a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say...   ...and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect.   all right. i'm going to stop right there. i have something to confess. i didn't write that.   readers of the vineyard gazette newspaper look forward to puzzle contributor sam hall's  popular brain power puzzle page each morning. sunday is word search day. the word search is the puzzle with the familiar cube of seemingly unrelated letters lined up in columns with an accompanying list of words for which to search. last sunday, those who played the word search, including the puzzle creator sam hall's wife, gilda , got quite a surprise. the puzzle was titled love letters. the list of words to search for included passion, trust, snuggle, companion, soulmates, best friend, eternity and till death do us part. the catch is that search as one might, the words could not be found in the puzzle. on closer inspection however, the letters in the column were not unrelated. if read start to finish left to right, they said, gilda, i am leaving you.   i don't love you anymore. my basset hound logi  is more energetic and stimulating than you. when i said i'd love you to the end of time, i didn't know that time would include waiting around while you play sims and farmville. i am sick of your nagging. i would rather perform sexual favors for kim jong-un on a bed of nails than spend one more night with you in your sleep number bed.
