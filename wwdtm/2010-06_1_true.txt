the harvard law school blog, john's law, set off a firestorm last week when an anonymous contributor claimed that during his days on the harvard law review, barack obama acted as an undercover ethics nark for the law school's disciplinary board. the blogger claims that he has unearthed files showing that obama filed reports on students who were suspected of violating the school's honor code. the students were offered a choice, a formal hearing in front of the disciplinary board, or a certain amount of community service time of pro bono paralegal work for local legal services or community service organizations. obama's identity was concealed, but he was regularly referred to as habeas the prince of torts.
