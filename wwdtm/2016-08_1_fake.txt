when jeffrey striker  died, he had one simple request. he wanted to be buried dressed as batman. in fact, it was a stipulation in his will. so you can understand why his family was so shocked when they arrived at striker's wake and saw that he had been dressed in the wrong year batman. striker was a big fan of the 1960s television show starring adam west, and the funeral director, charles hunter, had him dressed as "dark knight" starring christian bale. striker's mother florence said, it's hard enough losing jeff and now this. he hated the new batman. it's been a bad week. funeral director hunter said, i'm 32 years old. i've never even seen the television version. but before you could say holy embalmment, hunter apologized and asked if he could make it up to his family. he asked if he could add one more day to the viewing, free of charge, and then striker would be dressed as the correct version of the winged, caped crime fighter before being lowered into god's bat cave. the family agreed and striker's wishes were granted. striker's son chad said, there are two silver linings to this story. sure, it was stressful, but the extra day made it so that some of the family members who were at comic-con and had missed the first wake still got to see dad off. and two, at least he wasn't dressed as the clooney batman.
