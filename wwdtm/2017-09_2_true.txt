liam smith of bristol, england, has launched a gofundme campaign to pay for a new window in his flat. and since he's asking for your money, he felt honor bound to explain what happened. you see, mr. smith had invited a tinder date for a nightcap at his place. all was well until his date emerged from his bathroom in a panic. the poor woman had had to go to number two, which is bad enough when you're on a first date. but worse, the numero dos in question simply would not flush. so the panicked woman chose the only other logical option. she tossed her poo out the window.   a window that didn't actually open to the outside.   it was a double glass situation with a foot wide gap in between, which was now serving as a de facto doody display case.   mortified, she asked liam for a plastic baggie and climbed in headfirst after the offending item and promptly got stuck. the fire department had to be called and the window smashed to free the unlucky lady. facing a 300-pound bill for a new window, mr. smith shared the story on his gofundme page. any additional proceeds from the campaign will go to two charities, one to support firefighters and the other to build flushable toilets in the developing world.
