misplaced subtitles from the american children's show "dinosaur train" were inadvertently and inexplicably posted on a swedish television station broadcast of a debate between politicians.   while asa romson, minister for the environment, spoke into a thin microphone from a podium, looking quite serious, the swedish translation of the words greeting, earth creature appeared on the screen,   she continued to speak as such posts as i have two pairs of boots - one red pair and one yellow pair - displayed beneath her. unfortunately, only swedish-language speakers will ever know what she was really saying about the environment when the hearing-impaired swedes were led to believe she said, which one should i take? i'm going to ask my dolls.  minister of education jan bjorklund appeared to proudly announce i will build the best sandcastle in the galaxy.   and stefen lofven, prime minister of sweden, brought a sense of hope to the nation when he seemed to announce the latest invention - the fantastic dinosaur train submarine. only american political debates with correct subtitles could possibly be nuttier.
