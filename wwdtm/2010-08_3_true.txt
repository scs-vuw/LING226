you know the old adage, it's not what you say; it's in what font you say it that matters. so claims gil corbin, a quinnipiac university psychology professor and self-professed founder of a field he calls fontology. corbin points to the recent, intense public criticism of the cleveland cavaliers' owner, who wrote an excoriating open letter to lebron james in the font of comic sans.   it was like charlie brown trying to dress down king james. pathetic. he might as well have used wing dings, corbin says.   the psychofontologist believes that in these email-based, text- centric times, the font becomes a brand. your font is your face in the virtual world, declares corbin, who has a basset hound named baskerville old face.   and twin daughters named arial and verdana. so the next time you're thinking of sexting in chalkboard light, think again. you don't want to send your romance to helvetica in a handbasket.
