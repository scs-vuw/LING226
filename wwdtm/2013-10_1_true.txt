the nicest guy on "sex and the city" may have been stanford blatch, carrie's gay best friend. he was loyal, funny, quirky, sweet, almost perfect. so british supermarket chain tesco thought everyone should have one, too. hence the inflatable gay best friend, a novelty blow-up doll, quote, ready to give you fashion advice, tell you if your bum looks big and bitch about everyone who doesn't wear jimmy choos. igbf, as i like to call it, sports a pink top and blue shorts, which caused an outcry as an offensive stereotype, not to mention the shade of pink was all wrong.  but gay activists were more dismissive than upset. quote, "this is like trying to sell ice to eskimos," ben summerskill told the guardian. we can't imagine why any women would chose to buy an inflatable gay best friend when there are two million of the real thing already available in modern britain.  and most of them are much better looking than tesco's pale imitation. the chain has since apologized and withdrawn igbf from sale.
