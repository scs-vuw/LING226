the following is a portion of the court transcript of my testimony last tuesday before the franklin county board of police, judge david blistein  presiding. plantiff's attorney richard parra  - have you or have you not promised to leave the light on at all your properties? tom bodett, me - it's more of a sentiment than a promise. mr. parra - do you or do you not identify yourself and motel 6 then say we'll leave the light on for you? me - i do. mr. para - are you lying when you say it? me - it means we're expecting you. it's figurative. mr. parra - ms. o'connell's pain and suffering is anything but figurative. i understand the tagline we'll leave the light on for you was your invention. is this true? me - sort of. it's something my mother used to say. mr. parra - you're blaming this on your mother?   me - would it help if i did? she's dead. mr. parra - may the court please note mr. bodett's willingness to throw his own mother under the bus to save himself. me - she died of emphysema. where did the bus come from?   mr. parra - it's figurative.   judge blistein - judge blistein - you seem a lot smarter on the radio, and i've heard enough. the court rules in favor of the plaintiff. so unless we prevail on appeal, come january 1, all commercials for motel 6 will conclude i'm tom bodett, and we'll leave the light on for you - illumination in individual rooms may vary. use caution when entering and don't believe every stupid thing you hear on the radio.
