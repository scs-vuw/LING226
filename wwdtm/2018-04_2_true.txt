ian fincher  had been struggling to get his novel published for years. but it seems the publishing world wasn't quite ready for an epic survival story about a man who is allergic to peanuts but somehow gets trapped inside of a skippy factory and has to maneuver his way out before succumbing to anaphylactic shock.   he had been rejected by 37 publishers and was starting to doubt his skills as a storyteller. perhaps the novel needed some jokes in between the harrowing drama? he took his only hard copy of the novel, which he had printed at home and hand bound in leather, and headed to his favorite hiking trail for some inspiration. on the trail, he came upon another hiker who had fallen off one of the steep ridges and was moaning in pain. they determined that the injured woman had broken her leg and would need a splint to help her get back down the hill. after hesitating for just a moment, mr. fincher whipped his leather-bound novel out of his backpack and secured it tightly around the injured woman's leg. the two made it back to safety and called paramedics. recognizing the awkwardness of asking for his novel back, ian watched his now-bloodstained life's work get loaded onto a stretcher and carted off in an ambulance. but, it seems, this is what turned the hapless writer's luck around. the injured woman was none other than mary fayish  of fayish books . ian had been rejected by this publisher a year earlier, but mary fayish had plenty of time to reassess the novel during her hospital stay. i mean, what can i say? the guy's wordy as hell, but those thick pages saved my leg.   they at least deserve a 50-print run.
