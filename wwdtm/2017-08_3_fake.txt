people think prison breakouts need elaborate schemes or helicopters or morgan freeman boring the crap out of you with platitudes for 20 years in prison.   but a successful hoosegow getaway doesn't need to be that fancy or elaborate. take the case, this week, of 12 inmates of walker county jail in jasper, ala., who managed to temporarily shorten their stay at the big house with nothing more than a humble glob of peanut butter. taking advantage of a newbie screw, or a screwbie , if you will, that is to say a recently hired prison guard, one enterprising jailbird utilized the popular sandwich spread as a type of modeling clay and used it to alter the embossed number above one of the prison's communicating doors. the fresh-faced staff member, fooled into thinking the door now led back into the cells, rather than outside to glorious liberty, waved a dozen convicts through before he noticed his error. says walker county sheriff james underwood, he made a mistake. he hasn't been there that long. this young man was a weak link, and they knew it. the prisoners, who ranged in age from 18 to 30, and in appearance from smooth to chunky...   ...have all since been recaptured, having presumably run out of supplies with which to bribe any police dogs that were chasing them.
