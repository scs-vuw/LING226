actor steve guttenberg and his brother dack were closer than frick and frack growing up. but when the berlin wall fell 20 years ago, another wall went up between the two brothers. it was then that the printing press invented by their great-great-great-great- great-great grandfather johannes guttenberg was released by the formerly communist state to the sole surviving heirs, steve and dack. steve guttenberg was appropriately awed. the development of movable type was a revolutionary improvement over the handwritten manuscript, regularly considered a key factor in the european renaissance, he said. dack's take, meanwhile, yeah, old joe was a crafty sob, left us the gift that keeps on giving. while steve wanted to donate the press to the smithsonian, dack wanted to, quote, "soup this thing up, electrify it, start printing some of them guttenberg bibles. printing press? more like printing money. sorry, some of us don't have the luxury of sitting around counting our "three men and a baby" residuals all day.  and so the fate of the printing press is frozen in litigation.
