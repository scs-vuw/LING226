the torbert  trio, an unusual gang of bank robbers who have become a staple of news infotainment in ireland, have been caught by dublin police. county wexford natives and longtime employees of potato grower stanley farms  - connor murphy , sean kelly  and jack o'sullivan  have made their brief inglorious bank robbery fortunes by robbing banks armed with potatoes. we're tired of potatoes getting no respect, claims sean kelly. they've certainly added to the array of ways one might be asked to have their potatoes - baked, fried, whipped, mashed or pointed at you.   i started laughing at first, naturally. this fella comes to me with a potato gun and his partner with a slingshot loaded with a big huge potato. they both had big red noses strapped to their faces and little hats like mr. potato head as well. i couldn't take their  give us all the money in your drawer or we'll let the spuds fly seriously, says visibly bruised ulster bank teller chloe walsh .   i hesitated just a moment and this feller hit me right square in the face with a potato that could have fed a family of four.   they would've gotten away with it, too, says walsh, if their getaway driver hadn't been late on account of using a potato clock. those things never work.
