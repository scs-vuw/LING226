luxemburg is one of the richest countries in the world, boasting the highest gdp per capita on the planet, and a reputation as a tax shelter for wealthy foreigners. however, the newest hit show on luxemburgean television represents a bit of a backlash to the flashy quality of life enjoyed by its citizens. the premise of "extreme make-under home edition" is simple. a team of interior designers helps an incredibly rich, over privileged family turn their fabulous mansion into a less offensive temple of human greed.  the premier episode featured the cheshopfers, husband and wife stockbrokers who own a $30 million 20-room home. over the course of the show, a team of contractors turned their indoor ski lift into a simple game room, and gave the couple a framed photo of each other in place of their 20-foot porcelain statue of angelia jolie.  their solid gold escalators were replaced with stairs, and their personal imax theater was replaced with a television. as one enthusiastic viewer put it, "i love the show because these people are the worst."
