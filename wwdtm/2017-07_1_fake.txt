leslie tarpot, a topeka, kan., native, may be the first person to ever pop the question in a confessional. it all started innocently 20 years ago with her going to sunday mass at the sacred heart catholic church at topeka to hear father stevens deliver his sermons. she found herself daydreaming about stevens' message, how he made transubstantiation sound so sultry and seductive but, like, in a god-fearing way. things started getting a bit more serious for her when she started going to saturday mass as well. two days in a row of watching father stevens fill out his cassock and wave the censer and she found herself thinking not so much of the kingdom of god as the hotness of him. she started going to confessional once a week and then every day. not having many new sins to confess, they would chat about her life, their mutual interests and fun stuff like the pope's latest encyclical. after two full decades of chaste conversation, she said screw it. if god is love, he has to be down with this. so she went to confessional one day and laid bare her dirty, dirty soul by asking father stevens to marry her right through the screen. and, of course, as it turns out, father stevens had felt affection for her and many other unmentionable things for many years. he said, yes. he amicably left the church. he's now a tax accountant for the city of topeka and is enjoying connubial bliss for the first time in his life. asked about his new life, he said, it turns out, it's much more fun to sin yourself than just hear about it second-hand.
