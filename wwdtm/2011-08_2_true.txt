lithuania's place in european history is roughly the same as its place on the european continent, namely, on the far north side of the stuff you've actually heard of.  : no longer. scholars working with manuscripts from the 13th century at the university of vilnius have now announced lithuania's entry into one of europe's competitions. a lithuanian, they said, discovered america. the claimant is friar victor of vilnius, a benedictine monk and sailor. the friar, it is said, plied the baltic sea in a leather boat. he lived on bread and goat cheese. he also weighed approximately 280 pounds.  : nevertheless, the scholars say friar victor's journals of 1211 describe a "long voyage to where the sun dies," where victor describes the lands that sound very much like labrador or new brunswick. "he talks of tall pines and rocks that break the seas," says professor vedas marcellinus, who is heading up the project. "he also describes it as the homeland to the wild people of the hills. marcellinus concludes those to be native americans. skeptics say that friar victor might have only discovered scotland.
