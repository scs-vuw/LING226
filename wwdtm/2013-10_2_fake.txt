trainees at fbi headquarters in quantico, virginia, are being drilled in a new interrogation technique aimed at prying information and confessions out of suspects who are in custody. the suspect is left in a room with two agents and is shown an endless loop of videos from the television show "sex and the city."  originally, it was thought that it would take eight or nine hours of watching the episodes to elicit the desired result. but instructors at the fbi academy say in field experiments with the technique, even some of the most hardened suspects, break after only half of their first episode.  the technique is so promising that the fbi is already refining its details. agents are being educated in the differences between jimmy choos and manolo blahniks, the proper way to make a cosmo and the many different kinds of cupcakes you can find in new york city. and special investigative units are being put together made up exclusively of field agents named carrie, charlotte, miranda and samantha.
