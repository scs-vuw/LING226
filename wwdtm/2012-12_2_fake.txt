this year, the final float in the parade, with its traditional appearance of santa claus, was especially jolly, with industrious smiling elves scurrying in and out of an adorable santa's workshop, where periodic gouts from a hidden smoke machine hinted at the frantic toy-making going on within. except that there was no smoke machine. what there was, it was discovered after the parade, was a fully functioning and very real hookah.  yes, santa's elves had an extra bounce in their step and twinkle in their eyes because they were high on a lot more than holiday spirit.  the scandal was exposed by whistleblower and veteran elf david custable. quote, "some of the guys are definitely floating on the float every year, and that's fine," he said, "but to smuggle in an actual giant hookah pipe and put it where kids could potentially see it, while reeling around and giggling and waving, i couldn't let it go." elf ringleader russell lees counters that he brought the holiday cheer from california, where he obtained it legally for medicinal purposes.  when asked what medical condition he and the 15 other offending little people were suffering from, lees said, quote, "we all had an acute case of having to listen to endless christmas music for three hours while dressed as fricking elves."  "that's what i personally would call a chronic condition, if you know what i mean."
