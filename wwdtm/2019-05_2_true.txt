you thought travel made you urbane and sophisticated? yeah, right. turns out most of the tourists on easter island have the maturity of your average 12-year-old. the famous and mysterious stone statues erected between 1100 and 1400 a.d. are threatened because so many people are ignoring rules by climbing on top of the statues to get photos of themselves picking the giant noses...   ...of the sacred stone heads. these juvenile pranks are compounding the natural erosion of the fragile volcanic rock, all for a cheap instagram laugh. quote, "i'm troubled by the lack of genuine interest in the island and its people," university of california archaeologist jo anne van tilburg told newsweek. scientists estimate that the 150,000 tourists per year could ruin the world heritage site, destroying both the ancient art and the local economy, so island officials are creating new restrictions to limit access to the heads. so yes, you can choose your own adventure, but you can't pick its nose.
