finally, it's here -  - the product that can bring reliable hygiene to cats...   ... while bringing them closer to the caring cat owners.   licky brush, a rubber tongue available in a variety of bright colors. the tongue brush handle is gripped in the teeth of the pet owner willing to go the extra 4 and a half inches.   they then press the rubber tongue on the cat's ...  ...fur. draw their head back repeatedly and lick the cat as its mother always did. cats love it. owners love it. the makers of hairball relief products are the only possible unhappy parties in this win-win product success. once these fly off the shelves, we'll likely see the manufacturer branch out to rubber bird beaks for zookeepers grooming their rhinos and rubber tree- bark costumes for elephant handlers to allow their elephants to rub up against them.
