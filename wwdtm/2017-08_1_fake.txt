for weeks, london's scenesters  have flocked to max sheffield's private house club bony x  for a unique reason, peanut butter. dj-in-resident rolos  smears his speaker cones with peanut butter. and clubgoers claim the tones created by the sound waves passing through the sandwich spread create a trance-like state that mimics rem sleep, even while the listener is awake and dancing. rolos says he got the idea after dropping his phone in a jar of peanut butter just as he got a phone call. quote, "i use an old skrillex beat as my ring tone, and it sounded amazing. the bass wa deeper than a mine shaft. the guitar had dimensions i didn't know existed." plus, he added, laughing, i got to lick the phone, and it made my tongue tingle.   this week, though, the peanut butter dance party had to shut down after it proved too popular, attracting the type of client clubowners want even less than groups of dudes who don't bring women - millions of ants. they're gross. they're a health code violation. and, frankly, they're terrible dancers. rollo  at least is hopeful. we'll just have to see what i drop my phone into next, he said, before placing an ad on craigslist for, quote, "speakers barely used, somewhat sticky."
