the u.k.'s bexhill-on-sea was quite a quaint, little town until its exposure to the amway company. the town has become known as amway-on-sea. each amway member is instructed to relentlessly recruit more members into the cleaning and health and beauty product-based multi-level marketing company. they offer products and product demonstrations to their potential recruits. tea shops, parks, churches and public bathrooms are alive with amway recruitment. they'll actually come into a public loo, look under to spot feet and wait outside the stall to pounce on the prospect with a bathroom cleanser demonstration...   ...complains local resident betty trippany . from the demonstrations alone, every surface in the town is clean. local children's immune systems seem not to be developing as a result.   college graduations, baby showers, birthdays and weddings are marred by gifts of nutrition bars, replacement dispenser pumps and skin exfoliators. many recipients simply no longer have skin.   i can't even serve a cup of tea to a customer without them whipping out an amway multi-purpose cleaning pump spray, says waitress mary carter . i'd make a lot more money if the whole town hadn't gone broke selling amway.
