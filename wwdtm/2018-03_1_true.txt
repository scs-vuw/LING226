the reality show "britain's got talent" was rocked by controversy, leading to a police investigation all because a russian-born dancer's routines may have been a little too authentically russian. as dancer vlad olinks  advanced past the second and third rounds, there was a surprising upwelling of support for him on social media. the hashtag #whynotvlad was tweeted out 175,000 times in the course of a single hour with tweets reading, it's time for russian dance to take place. it's the best dance in britain. and russian dance - much, much gooder than silly kilt dancing.   producer john keane explains, quote, "we liked vlad from the beginning, and we love that type of online popularity which helps us market the show, but we noticed many tweets were coming from st. petersburg and moscow, which was a red flag - no pun intended..."   "...then we looked at the time the tweets went out, and we realized they hit a peak one hour before he actually performed." scotland yard was called in, who called in mi6, as it may have been a foreign attack on the sovereignty of british talent competitions.   at first, the counterintelligence experts thought it was silly. but then one anonymous agent said, quote, "we got a call from america's nsa, asking why we were checking an address they were monitoring - maybe it was the same fellows who hacked the american election, maybe russia is running their own talent competition for hackers."   it still might have worked out. but whoever was running the hacking operation didn't plan on one thing - singer deborah bailey's  rendition of "and i am telling you," in the semifinals. she blew dancing vlad right off the stage...   ...and right out of the show.
