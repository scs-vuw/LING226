every thanksgiving, children all over the country are forced to watch the macy's thanksgiving day parade.  and every year, apart from the size of al roker, it's exactly the same.   except for this year, when parade-goer ethan finkelstein noticed something unusual about the confetti fluttering down from the floats. "it landed on my friend's shoulder and says ssn and then it's written like a social security number. other strips were printed with phone numbers, addresses and license plates numbers, and some of them were even arrest records." it turns out the confetti was made from shredded police records from nassau county police department in new york. and worse, the records were shredded horizontally.  which, as it happens, is the same way the lines of information are usually written.  macy's has denied any involvement. nassau county is looking into the incident and released a statement, which can be found at the bottom of your hamster cage, if you're interested.
