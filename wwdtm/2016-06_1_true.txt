one day while house training his new puppy, yorgi borgida, the managing editor of the timisoara times in timisoara, romania, had an amazing idea. borgida was surprised at how many newspapers he went through covering the floor of his apartment to prevent his little shih tzu from shih tzuing everywhere. "i had to buy three copies of that day's paper," said borgida. "and i thought why not get other people to do the same thing?" that's why all over timisoara this week, people started seeing ads that feature a picture of a happy-looking pooch squatting over a pile of newspapers. the slogan, which has a few peculiar romanian idioms, roughly translates to your dog should leave his old food on our business. and it's working. this week alone, circulation is up 50 percent. special pee-pads for dogs are expensive, and the timisoara times costs about .15 cents. says a delighted borgida, "of course we'd rather people be reading our newspaper. but as long as they're buying it, we still get paid." not everyone at the times is happy. veteran columnist ivan shpiler wrote a sarcastic column in yesterday's paper entitled "my hard work is your dog's bathroom.  but the results are undeniable. and another publication in town has actually begun their own ad campaign arguing that their paper contains better reporting, an expanded culture section and a softer more gentle fiber that feels better on your dog's behind.  as for the timisoara times, borgida says they plan on expanding into bird cages, having their issues shredded for cat litter and are working with pampers to create the world's first news-diapers.
