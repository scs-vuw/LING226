recently translated manuscripts discovered in the depths of the vatican library revealed a curious restriction that was placed by pope paul iii on the participants on the council of trent, the gathering of catholic churchmen and intellectuals summoned to meet the rising tide of protestantism that met for eight years from 1545 to 1563. given the temper and volatility at the time, paul iii wanted simplicity and concision in all writings. so the pope mandated that no personal communication between council representatives could exceed 250 letters in length. thus, did pope paul iii invent twitter?  this is a remarkable find, said father giuseppe carbonara , the vatican library curator who oversaw the translation of the newly unearthed documents. it was the social media of the day, except that it was very carefully moderated. it was all business. no anonymous slander or cat pictures allowed.
