in myrtle beach, s.c., a local artist, steven diskin , is very popular. for the city's winter wonderland festival this week, he offered to do a large-scale, citywide art installation and set to work making the entire town look like the board of his favorite game, monopoly. several locations lent themselves to some obvious choices - the four local railroad tracks, the town's boardwalk, even a home and garden store owned by a man named jeff marvin , which was turned into marvin gardens. then, diskin made an interesting choice. he cordoned off an area in front of his house on a busy downtown street and painted the words, free parking. then, he started parking there and not putting any money in the meter. then, he got a ticket, which he ignored. and then, he got another, which he also ignored, and then, a third ticket after which he claimed he was being targeted by the police and sued the town for harassment.   after a heated exchange with the meter maid, in which mr. diskin told her she had, quote, "a monopoly on fascism," police had no choice but to tell mr. diskin to go directly to jail, not to pass go and not to collect $200. diskin finally relented and paid the $750 in parking tickets. but his financial fortunes are turning around since he recently came in second place in a beauty contest and walked home with a prize of $10.
