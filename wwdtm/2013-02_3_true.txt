yeah, your smart phone is pretty awesome. it can scan business cards, start your car, and monitor your baby all day long without your nanny even knowing. but can your dog poop on it? that's why you should never underestimate the power of print. for years, with the rise of smart phones, ipads and laptops, print newspapers have not been getting their due. now they're getting their doo-doo. a shortage of newspapers has meant that puppies at the san francisco animal control agency have been in danger of having nothing on which to poop. but now, the san francisco public library is saving the day, by donating old newspapers to line doggie cages. this is a real journalistic scoop.  this week, the library filled an animal control van with two 32-gallon recycling bins full of newspapers. the only potential critics of this contribution are the bay area second grade teachers who fear a generation of children will grow up without paper mache.
