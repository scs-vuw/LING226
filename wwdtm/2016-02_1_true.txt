the folks who run chipotle are exhausted from all the bad press. i mean, they are pooped, sick and turd of it all.  unfortunately, here's more - to placate loyal customers when its stores were shut down nationwide for a day to address food safety issues, the chain advertised a special promotion - text of the word raincheck to a six-digit number and get a free burrito. simple enough, except that due to a glitch, hundreds of messages sent from the d.c. area went not to chipotle but to bethesda, md., resident hank levine. when levine politely replied to texters that he had no burritos to give them, the you-know-what hit the fan, which i'm pretty sure is how chipotle got in trouble in the first place.  quote, "this isn't fit to print," said levine, "but one text said essentially get my bleeping burrito you bleeping bleep or i'll bleepity  bleep you. you learn what people are really like when you become a social media mistake. chipotle compensated levine generously with coupons for four free meals.
