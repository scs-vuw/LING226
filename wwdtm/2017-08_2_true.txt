nine-year-old logan frye  loves peanut butter - loves it. but his day camp and his school, like virtually every space for kids in america, are peanut-free zones. but when logan recently had to evacuate his camp bus, along with 47 other kids, because a piece of wood was mistaken for a snickers bar, his mother amanda started peanut butter camp in her own alpharetta, ga., backyard. she invites allergy-free families to come and go bananas with peanut butter.  i did it for my kid and other kids like him who love peanut butter, she says. i do understand that nut allergies are deadly for some kids, and i do pray for those families, but i wanted to create a nut freedom zone, a safe space where children and nuts can be together. amanda, of course, serves pb&js and nutter butters. but kids are also encouraged to roll around on a peanut-butter-covered slip 'n slide in her backyard called the scoot 'n smear .   there's peanut butter face painting. amanda also offers mothers a chance to be rubbed with peanut butter by an onsite massage therapist. and the ladies swear it leaves their skin super supple, even if dogs won't stop licking them.   everything was going great until outraged allergy activists reported her to local health authorities. so now the peanut butter camp of alpharetta, like every other public accommodation for children, has a nut-free zone.
