when carol dahmen of san diego discovered the cvs receipt draped across the kitchen counter, she couldn't resist pulling out her tape measure. her husband had purchased one single prescription, yet the receipt, she discovered, stretched out at an astonishing 4 feet 8 inches...   ...the height of olympic champion gymnast simone biles.   it's also the width of an antwan truffle reclining love seat, longer than the legal harvest limit for alligators in georgia and about the size of a good number of other random everyday objects you don't think about very much. this receipt is ridiculous and unnecessary, dahmen tweeted, calling for the scrapping of paper receipts for emailed versions. leaping into action at the ting of a tweet, democratic assemblyman phil ting of san francisco introduced a bill that would make emailed receipts the law for businesses grossing more than $1 million a year. rule breakers could be fined $25 a day and up to $300 a year - which, if you're grossing more than a million, is, like, nothing.   the state already bans single-use plastic bags and mandated that plastic straws be available by request only. if the e-receipt bill passes, california would once again become the first in the nation to crack down on another hidden hazard of our modern lives. they're wasteful, and they're toxic, ting said about the receipts. their lack of recyclability really makes them problematic - strong words from a mildly influential man.   rest easy, california.
