mubuku matobi, son of swaziland's president, was a ne'er do well. his playboy escapades had become so egregious that his father, abate matobi, canceled mubuku's allowance and foreswore responsibility for his debts. it was time for mubuku to get a job. he did come up with a project, an epic film depicting the sweep of swaziland history. it would need financing, of course. nice try, said day, no money. ok, said the son, no money. just lend me the army for a week, which was probably not enough time, as it turned out, to produce a blockbuster. the cast of thousands battle scenes were spirited but baffling, partly because both sides wore the same uniform.  nothing really worked in mubuku's movie except for the love scenes between mubuku, playing himself, and ngala omala, a stunningly beautiful machine gunner, whose performance earned her a modeling contract. last week, the two of them were reported in exile on the cote d'azure, recasting the whole story as a romantic comedy, tentative title, "rat-a-tat-tat."
