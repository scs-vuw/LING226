vienna, austria, is a conservative city not known for its raucous nightlife. but each december, the complaints against the world-famous vienna boys' choir get louder. make no mistake, we love our choir, says one anonymous resident, but this seasonal caroling is out of control. after 8 p.m., the only night i want is a silent night. but the choir sings outdoors until 9 p.m. and the city council has repeatedly affirmed their right to do so, which is why court records reveal a citizens' group went rogue and sought the assistance of notorious austrian gangster vienna fingers . fingers began a harassment campaign against the choir that most outlandishly involved pelting the boys with vienna sausages.   one boy was accosted by a masked man who threatened to pound him into wienerschnitzel.   still another boy was ordered to, quote, "stop singing and waltz his lederhosen home or he'd be dancing, all right, at the bottom of the blue danube." it's such an absurd situation, says one mother. who would ever believe this? right now, my boy is under his bed, hiden .
