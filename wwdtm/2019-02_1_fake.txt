a potential disaster was narrowly averted last week when two armed f-18 hornets were scrambled to respond to an airborne disturbance over an elementary school in the town of sedro- woolley, wash. we didn't know if it was going to be al-qaida or aliens, pilot john bolden told the skagit valley herald. it just looked like a cluster of some kind of small war craft on the radar. it turned out to be something much more sinister, five drones being piloted by five different parents watching their kids play during recess.   apparently, things started when jan saperstein, the mom of braden, a fourth-grader, heard from her son that the other kids were cheating at tetherball. using a drone camera that her older son, kaden, had, quote, "begged for and then never used, not even once," jan did uncover rampant tetherball and hopscotch cheating and even photo documented it, sending the drone pics to the school administrators. this led to a number of the accused kids' parents buying their own drones to gather their own evidence. the number eventually grew to five, known in aviation circles as an overparenting of drones.   the mid-air dogfights that had started breaking out posed a real danger to the students. but it was actually the noise from all those drones that proved to be the final straw, when 87-year-old lloyd laritz who lived near the school emerged from his house in full duck hunting camo and started shooting at the aircraft with a shotgun.   that was when the u.s. military got involved. and that was when mary purcell elementary school officially banned all drones. now, staring daggers across the parking lot during after-school pickup, that is still allowed.
