last month, typhoon lionrock brought devastation to a region in japan. among the casualties - one government official's reputation. shunsuke mutai, who was inspecting damage from the storm, encountered a large puddle and was faced with a dilemma. everyone else in the group was wearing rubber boots but mutai was not. he made a split-second decision and jumped on the back of a less senior official in what became a piggyback ride televised across the nation. cabinet secretary yoshihide suga, however, blasted mutai for his lack of sensitivity and preparation. quote, "he went there as head of the government investigation team, so naturally he should have brought his rubber boots to begin with," reports the bbc. a groveling mutai was forced to apologize saying he, quote, "deeply regretted the gaffe."
