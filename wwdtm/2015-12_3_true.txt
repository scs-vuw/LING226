donald trump and ted cruz might not like immigrants, but the customers at a staples office supply store in chino, calif., can't stop raving about one. that's because nicaraguan immigrant jose mendoza, who works at the store, has also started to treat customers in need of medical attention. mr. mendoza, who was a doctor in his native country, has yet to pass the medical board exams in the united states. however, when a recent customer cut a gash in her knee by knocking into a glass desk, mr. mendoza - or el doctor as he's come to be known - quickly helped stop the bleeding by using a stapler to staple her knee shut. once management found out about el doctor's skills, they agreed to let him set up shop at the store, even using some of the office furniture as a waiting area. on a given day, he'll see 10 to 20 patients in aisle nine, said george stewart, the store manager. he's got all he needs. you've got broken bones? he's got masking tape. you got scars? he's got white-out - ear infection? paperclips, although i'm not sure how that one works. when we reached el doctor by phone, he said in my country i was in the military, so i was a general. but i was also a doctor, so i was a general practitioner. i come to america, the board exams take a long time, so i get a job at staples because it's close to my house and i get free office supplies. el doctor is the perfect solution for those who can't afford health insurance or find themselves opposed to the affordable care act. you come in, you by some ink, maybe a ream of paper, maybe some post-its, and i check your prostate.   it's a win-win and you leave clean. we have purell.
