every grandmother thinks their grandchild is perfect. but if you had the chance, wouldn't you want to make sure before it was too late? roger kato's mom, lindsay, was delighted when he told her that he and his girlfriend wendy were engaged. but lindsay became obsessed with one question, and it wasn't the wedding date. what would her future grandchild look like? how about their health? since wendy's relatives weren't around, the only solution was to get a sample of wendy's dna. she thought it would be easy. but as it turned out, her future daughter-in-law is a bit of a germaphobe. mom offered wendy a taste of cookie dough thinking she'd get dna from the spoon, and wendy whipped out her own sterilized spoon.   mom suggested to wendy that she looked feverish and offered to take her temperature, but wendy had her own ear thermometer.   mom tried the direct approach, saying it would be fun for the family to send in their dna and find out their backgrounds. wendy's response? those companies keep and sell personal info, so no way. by this point, lindsay was convinced wendy was a spy or a mutant or worse. she had to have that sample, which is why lindsay kato, 63, was arrested at 3 a.m. at the offices of a tustin, calif., gynecologist in the possession of a stolen urine sample.   as a first-time offender, ms. kato will most likely be sentenced to the minimum six weeks in jail. but having finally gotten wendy to show her some family pictures, she will spend the time in jail bragging to her cellmates about her tall, blond future grandchildren with a pension for athletics.
