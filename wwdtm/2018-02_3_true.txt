it seemed like matilda bruner had it all - a great house, plenty of friends and all the stardom that comes with being berlin's most celebrated dominatrix.   she dominated the entire field - till it said its safe word.   but there was always something missing from bruner's life, her beloved doberman, pinchy . when she was a little girl, they played together. they growled at visitors together. and it appears his taste in collars always stuck with her.   but when she'd gone away to summer camp as a little girl, she came back to find him gone. my parents said he'd gone to live on a farm somewhere, but i knew it was a lie. i tried replacing him once with a pet land crab. it wasn't the same, but the name pinchy still worked.   that might have been the end of a sad story if not for her impulsive stop at a roadside saturday flea market. as frau bruner made her way along the tables piled with bric-a-brac, she found herself looking face to face with her beloved pinchy. he had been expertly stuffed and mounted in a standing position. his lips were curled in a snarl, and he was wearing the collar remembered.   i knew it was my pinchy. matilda has no idea how pinchy ended up as taxidermy alongside a german byway. maybe they tried to make him like this for me but thought he turned out too scary. who knows? the important thing is he's mine now. and we sit to watch tv every night together. he was a doberman. now he is an ottoman.
