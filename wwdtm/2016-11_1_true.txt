back in the '90s, one of the biggest rap acts was jazzy jeff and the fresh prince. we all know what happened to will smith after his rap career, but what about his former partner, jazzy jeff? well, if you're jazzy jeff, you just fly away. jeff townes, which is his real name, always had a love of aircraft. and after his music career ended, he had money, time and curiosity, so he began taking flying lessons. he got his commercial license and now flies private jets. and if the story ended here, it would be a nice, where are they now, happily ever after ending type story. of course, the story doesn't end here. whenever jeff is flying a client from the entertainment industry, he bombards them with demos through the pa. he really looks forward to transcontinental flights because then he can get deep into his catalog. passengers have used the term hostage. stars like p. diddy, jay-z, even quincy jones, have refused to pay for their flights and swear they'll never use the jet company again. jeff's boss, adam reswick , has tried to limit jeff to business flyers, but jeff will use his formerly famous name to manipulate other pilots into switching flights with him to get the music clients. reswick has sympathy because jazzy jeff was left behind by the fresh prince, but says, quote, "i like jeff, but when kanye west calls someone overbearing, you got to listen."
