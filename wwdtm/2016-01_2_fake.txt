for years, japan's birthrate has been plummeting. but just last month, government officials gleefully announced the birthrate is starting to show the tiniest bump. ninety-two-thousand babies were born december, up 27 percent from the previous year. government officials are lighting cigars over this news because it was they who conceived a new children's television show dedicated to giving parents a half hour to make babies. the state-run show is called peko peko arcachon, which roughly translates to baby time. it began airing last year, and immediately became a national tradition. millions of kiddies in footie pajamas sit on their tatami mats in front of the tv. their parents turn it on, then close their bedroom door to get it on. the host of the show is an adorable anime blastocyst called pokeyourmom.  pokeyourmom keeps the children of japan riveted, offering them plenty of action while their parents get some action. every episode features role play with chopsticks, sticky rice snowball fights, songs about not knocking on mommy's door.  instead of commercials, the friendly day-five blastocyst reminds kids to go the potty and brush their teeth. and at the 22-minute mark, it's the climax of the show...  ...when pokeyourmom encourages children to make tons of noise.  in a country where most 8-year-olds still sleep in a family bed, this window of baby- making time is valuable. still, yukiko sasaki, a mother of 4-year-old twins, says i don't know why we need a half hour. ten minutes is enough.
