staying alive during these difficult economic times has required some companies to cut employee comforts. t&j auto parts supply company owner stan tichinsky in somerville, mass found $50,000 a year savings cutting employee coffee. but to assuage rankled worker attitudes, he installed coffee bean plants. "we were quite happy," said employee michael bonner, "until we realized it takes four to six years to grow any beans. my break is only 15 minutes."  "we were up there with cups the first day. i stole a bunch of sugars from the ihop." the employees have largely detoxed from caffeine as a result. "that wasn't really my plan," says tichinsky, "but they say they feel better. i'll take credit for that. we take turns taking care of the plants, and in a couple of years, we'll have the t&k auto parts supply house blend. i can't wait to see what unexpected perks come from using our parking lot snow for drinking water."
