emily mason  is a structural engineer getting her ph.d. at cornell university. in between projects, she indulges her hobby - surfing through the dozens of instagram accounts devoted to her favorite building, the leaning tower of pisa. tourist pictures fall into a few different categories. there's, oh, it's so tiny. i can squeeze it between my fingers. or the inevitable oh, no. this tower belongs in my trousers.   so many tourists were taking selfies with the tower in the background that the city of pisa installed a wooden selfie platform 200 yards away. but starting about six months ago, the american engineer noticed something odd. in dozens of selfies posted over the course of several weeks, the tower appeared to be straightening itself ever so slowly. she analyzed the photos and estimated that, at this rate, in only five years, this tourist landmark would have to be renamed the-not-very-interesting-tower-in-some-italian-town.   after publishing her findings in a paper called "lean on: a famous tower finally goes straight," officials in pisa officially freaked out. an international team of experts, armed with lasers and ladders, closed the tower down while they investigated this mystery. a belgian engineer finally figured out what was happening. woodchucks had burrowed under the wooden selfie platform. and it was starting to lean at an angle...   ...opposite of the towers. they said,  falso alarme.   the american engineer has been forced to apologize.
