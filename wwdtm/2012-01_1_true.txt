when you find yourself up in the great white north, tied to the railroad tracks or in some other sort of dire need, and you call for help, you know who always arrives to get their man, right? of course, i'm talking about the royal canadian jedi knights.  : yes, dudley do-right, meet dudley skywalker. as part of a community policing initiative, the mounties new law enforcement partners are government-funded local quasi-militias, who, starting in 2012, have the right to name and outfit themselves, which naturally has led to an enterprising group of nerds founding edmonton's jedi knight, a 14-man force dedicated to combating canada's dark side. quote, "the light sabers are only ceremonial, like most military swords these days," say jedi master sean nacery.  :"but our job is real. and it turns out that the ways of the force are pretty compatible with canadian law and our environment can be not unlike the ice planet hoth."  : still, it's clear that the young padawans are less equipped to deal with real terrestrial danger than their professional mounted cousins. so if you do find yourself in peril out there, well, may the horse be with you.
