brian christie is a respected canadian pro figure skater. but christie has a secret. christie is completely unable to perform unless his six-foot burmese python, mr. slinky, is in the arena. this oddity came to light recently when rink officials caught christie and his manager trying to smuggle mr. slinky into a winnipeg arena in an oversized beer cooler, for a charity salute to "the sound of music" on ice.  : christie was seen backstage shaking and apparently in tears. he was unable to take the ice to perform his signature piece, "the lonely goat herder in lederhosen."  : the obsession began when christie first met the snake, during a britney spears' themed show.  : in which christie skated to "i'm a slave 4 u," with the serpent around his neck. he said, "it was the best skating i ever did in my life. i got hooked." fans have started an online petition drive to allow the python into future performances, called "snakes for skates."
