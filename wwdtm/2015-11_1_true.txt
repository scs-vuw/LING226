"spectre," the latest james bond movie opened this weekend. critics panned at star daniel craig's stoic acting but praised the action sequences. but now it looks like some backstage drama might upstage the on-screen action. daniel craig is suing roger smith , a former sound technician, over leaked audiotapes where the movie star can be heard shrieking, crying and screaming as he's performing stunts in the film. in one action sequence, craig is dangled upside down over mexico city as he clings to a helicopter. in the audiotape played on tmz, a man's voice can be clearly heard over the sound of the helicopter crying, screaming and pleading for help. smith described the sound as quote, "a piglet being chased by a mongoose which is being slowly eaten by a wolverine." the man on the tape can also be heard very clearly shrieking, i so scared, mommy, in addition to some very un- bond-like swear words.
