best scheister, mouthpiece of honor. melissa carlson, owner of vow events, one of the southern california's largest wedding planning companies, says there's a new fashion in wedding ceremonies. the groom waits at the alter with his lawyer while the bridge is escorted down the aisle by her lawyer.  : partly, this is the result of complicated modern families, says carlson, sometimes a bride will have two or three stepfathers and no real father in the picture. also, just the one traditional best man and one maid of honor excludes too many people in this 3,000 bffs on my facebook page era. but, says carlson, the real reason is prenups. these contract negotiations, it's so complicated that the bride and groom end up being closer to their lawyers than anyone else. ralph mercer, a los angeles attorney specializing in marriage law, confirms the trend. several of the partners in his firm have given away the bride. well, says mercer, not given away, we're lawyers, it's a $200 hourly billing rate, reception included.
