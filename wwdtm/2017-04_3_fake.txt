of all the things that can go wrong in an uber driver's day, getting deported, one-starred or stabbed are not even in florida driver bree's  top five. before starting the second day of her job, bree had spent the night before at her boyfriend's apartment. as she related on her twitter account later, my man told me he was going to new york to see his mom. she's in the hospital. he had luggage packed and everything. i picked a girl up at the airport. she puts his apartment complex in the gps and says she's here to visit her boyfriend. she's so excited. she hasn't seen him in forever. i'm relating, like, yeah, my man just left town. well, as they cruise through the apartment complex, counting down the buildings, bree says, my stomach starts to drop as we get closer to a familiar building and i see his car outside. i was burning up inside when she said, i think this is it right here. this is his car. then things got awkward.   after bree was done beating up her boyfriend and left him with his confused mistress, who had no idea what had come over her driver, bree drove away with the woman's things still in the car. anyways, she tweeted, looking on the bright side, this is the reason i have new luggage.
