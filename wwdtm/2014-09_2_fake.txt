when beaux clarence woke up to find his wife audra snoring on the dog bed beside their english bulldog clive, he chalked it up to sleep walking. when he noticed her spending lots of time on all fours, he assumed she was focusing on her yoga practice. but when they went for a weekend stroll and audra started to lift up her leg by a fire hydrant, beaux knew something wasn't right. turns out audra was suffering from a bizarre side effect of a new drug called thyralox  used to treat thyroid disorders. doctors have been seeing more and more patients on thyralox who are behaving like their pets. at first, we thought the animal behavior was caused by their condition says dr. bev solow, head of endocrinology at harvard. but then we realized we were barking up the wrong tree.  it's actually the drug that's causing it. a spokesperson for thyralox cheekily refused to comment, stating only our research team is looking into these claims, but until then, we're muzzled. but one man being treated with this drug declared he'd rather experience the sluggishness and weight gain associated with hypothyroidism than have his kids pull him off the mailman's ankles again.
