neale says he was shocked when he realized just how massive the brassica napobrassica he'd cultivated was. but things got even weirder when the retired farmer received a personal video message from none other than snoop dogg. yes, that's right, the snoop dogg, also known as rapperus americanus.  : snoop recorded a youtube video praising neale's horticulture and offering him backstage passes to an upcoming show in cardiff in exchange for green thumb tips on how the rapper could also grow giant, um, vegetables. that's right, vegetables.  : in what obviously was just some weird unrelated coincidence, the dogg father recorded the video message in front of a backdrop of hundreds of marijuana plants. neale says he's flattered by the attention but is passing on the chance to meet snoop, claiming he's more of a country and western fan.  : snoop reportedly took the brush off in stride, spending the afternoon playing video games, eating pizza rolls and contemplating how weird it is that we, like, have fingers.
