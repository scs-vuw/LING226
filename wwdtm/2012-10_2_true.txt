emily mason got tired of leaving her tabby cat chester behind when she went on vacation. so last summer, she and chester traveled together to kitty corners, the country's first ever resort for cats and the people who can't live without them. kitty corners is where the line between feline and human blurs and visitors experience life as their cats do. rooms are furnished with giant chairs people can curl up on and human-sized carpeted climbing and scratching posts.  : in the grooming gallery, cats and their owners are taught to always lick their paws after scratching and mutual grooming techniques. mason said she and chester had a good time at the resort, chasing the light from the flashlight across the floor and getting entangled in a giant ball of yarn. she briefly hung from a curtain until her fingernails gave out.  : and then the two ate salmon and lapped up half and half together at the hotel bar.  : then they got high on catnip and passed out in a giant drawer of sweaters.  : mason said she'd definitely take her cat again, but there was only one thing she'd change. "the litter box experience, i could do without that," she said.
