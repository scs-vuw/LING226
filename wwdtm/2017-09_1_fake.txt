during flooding events like hurricane harvey in texas, a lot of people never think about what happens to all the gophers.  big jim harvey, no relation to the storm, is not one of those. gophers are literally at ground minus zero in a flooding disaster...  ...says harvey, who is a conservationist and texas pocket gopher advocate. big jim estimates 500,000 gophers were made homeless in the houston area, inspiring him to host a barbecue to raise money on their behalf - for resettlement, he adds. now, i know a lot of people would kill these things with their bare hands because of what they do to their lawns. but what folks don't realize is gophers are the tip of the suburban biosphere. they do a lot of good, eat a lot of things that are worse than they are. and we don't always appreciate that. and if you all come by my bbq on sunday, i'll be happy to enlighten you, share some of that crate of frozen chicken that washed up on my lawn - it still smells fresh - and hopefully earn your support.
