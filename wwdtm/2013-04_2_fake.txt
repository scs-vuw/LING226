is your dad's chili con carne recipe being investigated by the fbi as a weapon of mass digestion? could your aunt shelly's cheesy pleasy meatloaf pass as a breeding plantation for a new class of antibiotics? have you ever gone to a family dinner and left by way of the emergency room?  clara gallagher had this problem. after her grandmother made her eat a dish called veal pucklettes, the utica, new york native invented the body buddy, a series of specially shaped containers which sensitive-stomached diners can use to spirit out unwanted and uneaten entrees from family meals. her specially designed tupperware-style container fits snugly into a bedazzled evening bag, allowing her to smuggle food in and out. a 12-ounce flask strapped to the inside of the leg comes in handy during eggnog season.  the inventor says, my cousin, bobby, caught me shoveling away at our aunt carol's three-cheese rice krispies treats, and he asked me for one. so now it comes in camouflage for the guys. this isn't about nutrition, it's about preserving family relationships and stomach linings.
