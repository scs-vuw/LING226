this week's cautionary tale comes from central spain where a friday night tryst took an abrupt turn towards worst date ever. a young couple was getting frisky on the top of a local well when the wooden cover gave way and the 21-year-old woman plunged 10 meters, about 30 feet, into the water. she's fine but you're probably thinking, way to kill the mood, huh? then the hapless romeo did the unthinkable - he fled the scene, although police believe he was the anonymous tipster who called emergency services. spanish daily abc reports that the half naked woman was rescued by firefighters and treated for hypothermia at a local hospital. city officials quickly issued a warning to young lovebirds because there are a number of old wells near the popular outdoor drinking spot. but it's unclear if the woman's date will face charges for say, hit and run, or walk based on the old adage - alls well that ends well.
