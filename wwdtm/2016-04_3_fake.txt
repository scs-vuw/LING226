finally, after 20 years, canadian songstress alanis morissette has apologized for her misuse of the word ironic.  in the song "ironic," she defined the word as  like rain on your wedding day...  ...a free ride when you've already paid. isn't it ironic, she asked? no, said oxford english dictionary editor oliver pusey.  irony is a disparity between what is expected and what actually happens. if you lived in seattle and held your wedding in death valley specifically to avoid rain, but then on your wedding day, it was sunny back home in seattle and rained in death valley, well, then that would be ironic.  as for paying for a ride that was in fact supposed to be free, that's not a matter of irony. that's a matter for the better business bureau.  and a black fly in your chardonnay is nothing to sing about in the era of the zika virus.  "i realize now," conceded morissette in a statement, "that my lyrics describe events that aren't ironic but merely crappy."  pusey is now meeting with faith hill. we want to know how any kiss results in centrifugal motion, meaning fleeing from center. or did she mean to say that kissing results in a sensation of centripetal - center-seeking motion? for the sake of her own perpetual bliss, we hope the latter. for the record, mr. pusey has not kissed anyone in 30 years.
