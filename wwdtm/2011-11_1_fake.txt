the good people of tipton, indiana liked to have a laugh at the expense of dr. michael baarf.  : no matter how often he told people his name was of dutch origin and spelled with two a's, they just couldn't stop giggling. what's worse; patients weren't all that excited to use an ob/gyn with his name. after all, when someone asks, "oh, who delivered your baby," it's kind of hard to say, "oh, dr. baarf, he was wonderful."  : and men don't need another reason to get queasy in the delivery room. the good doctor had accepted his fate until two weeks ago when he was driving home from the hospital and came upon a terrible accident. a school bus had flipped upside down in a ditch, trapping the children inside. thinking fast, dr. baarf retrieved an ax from his trunk and smashed open several windows, allowing every single child to crawl out to safety. well, tipton, indiana laughs no longer. the mayor has decreed that the date of the incident, october 21st, will forever be known as baarf day.  : and acts of heroism in town are being referred to by a new name. says police chief jordan richardson, one of my officers got an old woman's cat out of her tree, and as he was leaving, she said, "thanks for baarfing, officer."
