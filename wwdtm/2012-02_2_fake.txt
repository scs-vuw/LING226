individual political contributions are way up, and dr. elliott kerwin, economics professor at stanford university, has analyzed 50 years of statistics that indicate during periods of economic optimism, not only do political donations rise, they also become less rational. that is to say we tend to donate contrary to our own self-interests. you may remember back during the tech boom when we all got so crazy with our money that we donated to ralph nader, right.  : now, dr. kerwin is not sure, he says, what his trend correlation means. but he says what with wall street billionaires bankrolling tax-happy obama and mitt romney getting donations from exactly the kind of people he fired when he was at bain, and even a penny being spent on ron paul...  : we obviously have money to burn.
