like a lot of western parents, china's li feng had a recalcitrant 23-year-old son, who sat at home playing online computer games instead of trying to hold down a job. but instead of attempting touchy-feely solutions, like career counseling or therapy, mr. feng chose a strategy that might seem out of step with our modern western parenting. he hired a team of assassins and turned them loose on young xiao feng. suddenly, whenever xiao feng signed on to his favorite game, world of warcraft, a stronger character would instantly appear and eliminate xiao feng's character.  if he could never play the games without being instantly murdered by virtual hit men, mr. feng reasoned, xiao feng would lose interest and find a job. mr. feng was wrong, at least about the job part. quote, "i can play or not play, it doesn't bother me," the son said. quote, "i'm not looking for any job. i want to take some time to find one that suits me," which made the older feng realize what he now considers the one flaw in hiring virtual assassins for your children: the virtual part.
