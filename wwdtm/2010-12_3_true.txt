what is it like to look into the face of sheer evil? ask rick raymond, buster of gold brickers, scourge of pseudo-sickos. the current economy, which makes whiners feel trapped in their jobs, has brought on a surge of malingering, reports businessweek magazine. and that means boom times for private eyes like rick. workers call the office and claim they've caught some kind of bug, they've been run over by a truck, they can't seem to shake that brain tumor.  right, right, they are stealing from their employer just as surely as if they were breaking into his home and threatening him and his loved ones, maybe even slapping his pets around at gunpoint until his lawyer gives up the combination of his safe. but they don't get away with that for long, not after their company calls in a crack private investigator. a rick raymond will surveil a phony sufferer until he sees into his very soul. and at the first sign of health, that's when the shirker's true inner sickness is laid bare.
