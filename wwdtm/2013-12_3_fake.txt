sometimes in detroit your dream is there for the asking. just talk to bill gould, a guy who is living his. that dream is the carbyrinth. anybody could have a corn maze, says gould. i have a car maze. gould bought the shell of an old oldsmobile dealership and decided to use two acres of the parking lot as his maze area. then i asked people to drop off their old junkers, any old car, he says. and boy did they. hundreds of banged-up beaters, wreck and hoopties in various stages of decay showed up on the lot. gould and a buddy with a crane, using a diagram from the internet, piled up the cars to form an intricate labyrinth. the carbyrinth opened at halloween, $7 per person or $20 per family, and it's been a huge hit. kids love running around in these old cars. it makes for great echoes, he says. every night at sunset the crew tows out one unlucky wreck and torches it, and everybody cheers.  gould is planning a whole theme park with a car carousel, car ferris wheel, you name it. it's the spirit of detroit, he says.
