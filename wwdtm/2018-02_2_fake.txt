if you've got a secret you don't want getting out, never put it in writing, never share it in a recording and never ever tell it to the australian government. this week, hundreds of classified top-secret documents were released to the public after they were discovered in two old filing cabinets at a secondhand shop in canberra. the cabinets had previously belonged to the australian government, which had lost the keys to the locked drawers and sold them off in a government used furniture sale with top-secret files still inside.  yes, apparently, the australian government operates very much like your senile uncle wilbur.  an unnamed person bought the cabinets, quote, "for small change" and took a power drill to the locks. discovering the files inside, they handed them over to the australian broadcasting corp., who began publishing some of the documents this week. among the embarrassing revelations - a former prime minister consider denying welfare to anyone under the age of 30, calling them job snobs, and another consider removing the right of people to remain silent under police questioning - awkward.  cabinet officials cannot believe they are being undone by actual cabinets.
