ever wonder who came up with hillary clinton's iconic pantsuits - posh spice of the '90s girl group spice girls, according to an article this week in britain's daily mail. back in 1998, the teenage chelsea clinton was a huge fan of the british supergroup and thrilled when her mother arranged for a white house meeting during the group's u.s. tour. the spice girls gave chelsea a pink girl power jacket and gave the then-first lady a custom red pantsuit by victoria adams, aka posh spice, an aspiring fashion designer who went on to marry david beckham and launch her own successful fashion line. hillary loved the pantsuit so much, according to sources close to beckham, that the singer became a secret consultant over the years, urging hillary to wear bright primary colors, to cut and lighten her hair and even facetiming her with outfit advice before big speeches and debates. beckham declined to comment for the article. a spokeswoman for clinton said she, quote, "has always loved pantsuits from a variety of talented american designers" but admires beckham's, quote, "global entrepreneurship and work-life balance."
