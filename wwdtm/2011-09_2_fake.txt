mark anthony delaru is one of the most promising young jockeys in the country, having piled up an impressive string of winners at louisiana downs and at saratoga during the recent meet there. he's managed to do this despite one overwhelming physical disadvantage, he is violently allergic to horses.  : delaru discovered this as a teenager, working as a stable boy at louisiana downs. doctors told him that the substances in a horse's perspiration caused him a severe rash. his father, a veteran trainer, hit upon the notion of encasing his son partially in bubble wrap. now, before every race, delaru applies a mixture of vegetable oil and desitin to his lower body and his arms, after which he winds the bubble wrap tightly around himself, and then goes out on the track. the other jockeys have taken to calling him "bubble boy," but delaru already has an endorsement deal with staples.  : he won four straight starts at the fairgrounds, and he is the fourth leading money winner this year at saratoga. "you hardly notice it before the race," said paul lamaru, another veteran jockey, "but when mark anthony goes by, he sort of squishes and pops. it's weird sounding."  : "the biggest thing i worry about is the effect on the horse," delaru explained. "the last thing you want pounding down the stretch is a racehorse thinking somebody's shooting at it."
