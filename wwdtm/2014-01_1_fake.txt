it was sad news in the world of economics last week when nobel prize-winner dale mortensen passed away. aside from family and close colleagues, the person most devastated by his death was likely a guy in maine named finley edwards. why? well, because dale mortensen was the star of edwards' fantasy economics team. the ideas fantasy economics league allows econ geeks to put together a virtual economics department using real economists who score points through citations, number of downloads and other metrics. think fantasy football with somehow, incredibly, even less sex appeal.   well, unless dudes yelling i want krugman gets you hot and bothered for some reason. with wacky nicknames like zero marginal product, solo strikers and university of atlanta, some 200-or-so teams have taken part in the league. unshockingly, the teams are mostly run by other academics and economists. but however esoteric, the league does seem to be making stars out of these economists, at least in their own minds. one of them reportedly took to twitter boasting that he was trading higher than another scholar who happened to be one of his major ideological opponents. oh no you didn't fail to account for the effective arbitrage pricing theory, dr. patel.
