there was a time when unlucky criminals had to worry about cops seeing them or hearing them, but when cops literally smell you, your luck is just bad. a cannabis factory in leicester, england, was sniffed out by police after they wound down their car windows to escape the smell of one officer continually breaking wind.  the officer with a wind problem had been on a high-protein diet after taking up bodybuilding. after a few fits of giggles and denials, they all realized a desire to eat twinkies. that's when they noticed a cannabis smell in the air outside, and it smelled much better than the air inside the car. all three officers' suspicions were raised, and they left the car to find the cause of the cannabis smell and, of course, to breathe. seven people at the property in leicester were arrested. it was a good collar, and it was all down to this officer and his flatulence, a police source said.
