not since lois lane has a reported gone to such extremes to get a story and, remember, she was never really in danger. she had superman. when new york times reporter zahir raab became privy to allegations of bullying and a "look the other way" policy on the part of administrators at patton elementary school in fishkill, new york, he enrolled. that's right he enrolled. although he is 25 years old, raab is wiry, short and apparently capable enough of passing for a second grader.  :"i didn't like what i found," says raab, "the culture of bullying ran quite deep. from day one, my beard and mustache drew unwarranted snickering."  :"and kids pulling my tie became as common as raising their hands to ask to go the bathroom. the english teacher never liked me, which may have been because i corrected her grammar, but still."  :"as i read aloud my essay on what i want to do when i grow up, i'm sure heard her derisive laugh the loudest, amidst the cacophonous uproar when i came to the part about my retirement plan."
