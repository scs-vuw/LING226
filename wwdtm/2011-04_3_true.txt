here's a multiple choice. if you're a state-funded unemployment agency trying to connect with the jobless community, do you a: offer counseling seminars, b: host a jobs fair, or c: spend $14,000 on red superhero capes for the jobless as part of your flagship capability program?   well, if your name is workforce central florida, the answer is obvious; grab those capes and encourage the jobless to fight a cartoon character named dr. evil unemployment. as it turns out, the idea of dashing into a phone booth to change clothes wasn't such a hot concept with a group of people who are in danger of genuinely having to do so.   and this week, the program was denounced by the state director as, quote, "insensitive and wasteful." workforce central florida director gary j. earl defends the program saying that his agency has also recently placed 59,000 people in jobs. presumably in the burgeoning fields of newspaper reporting, newspaper photography and teaching at schools for gifted mutants.
