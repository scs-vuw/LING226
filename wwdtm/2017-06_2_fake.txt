a company in hamburg, germany is making headlines after an advertisement of theirs made its way around the internet last week. tote bazook  specializes in giving you back the loved ones you've lost for your important life celebrations like birthdays, weddings, christenings and bachelor parties. did your bro bounce and leave you lonely? do you want to honor your life's evolution by including someone that death's icy hand has already claimed? look no further. tote bazook has designed an extensive, highly intelligent survey that will provide all the information needed for an actor to show up at your celebration and pretend to be your dearly departed loved one. i know, right? crazy.   clothes, hair, body type, catchphrases - they'll incorporate it all into the new body of your loved one so you don't have to pass milestones without them. it was amazing, said john streusel , who is a real person. we had someone come to my bachelor party and take the place of my friend hons , who died last year. hons owed me $20 when he died, and the new hons paid it back with interest. they made me give it back at the end of the party. but still, the new hons was way cooler than the dead hons.   take that, science and mother nature.
