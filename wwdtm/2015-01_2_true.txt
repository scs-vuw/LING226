if you think it's easy to hail down a cab, try being a black man.  this is where the bigot buster can help. it's a new device at this year's consumer electronics show that promises to trick cabdrivers into stopping for black men.   you wear it around your wrist like a watch or some fancy handcuffs. and when you need to catch a cab, you just press a button, and it projects an incredibly realistic hologram of a white woman trying to get to cab.  designer ben calhoun told the chicago tribune, quote, the hologram looks just like a real white woman holding a 2-year-old kid who's holding a puppy.   what cabdriver is going to ignore that? admittedly, the trials of the prototype haven't gone so great. so far, calhoun says, most cabdrivers slow down because they think you're trying to rob the white woman that's holding the toddler and the puppy.   quote, i think it's time for us just to add a second puppy because people love puppies.
