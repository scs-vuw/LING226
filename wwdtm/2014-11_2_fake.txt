like most schools, william heart elementary in dubuque, iowa has a problem with kids using cell phones in class. one of the teachers noticed the epidemic when she momentarily looked up from her own phone several months ago. so in the spirit of, if you can't beat them, join them, the school came up with a way to make cell phone use an interactive school-wide activity. this month they hosted the first annual ilympics, which had kids compete for medals in a variety of phone-related challenges. in one contest, kids try to remember their home phone numbers, addresses and parent's names without looking at their phones.  the student who remembered the most using his human powers of memory won the gold. another competition timed students to see who could go the longest without touching their phone. caitlin goldstein took first place with an astounding 17 seconds.  then there was the battery life challenge, where contestants are given a 10% charge on their phone and have to multitask. the first one to run down the battery wins. this year's gold medal was won by simultaneously streaming a justin bieber video while listening to keisha and facetiming with her friends. she was also live tweeting. it was easy, she said. that's pretty much what my friends do every day anyways.
