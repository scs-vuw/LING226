8.7 million people ride the tokyo subway every day. and for almost 50 years, japanese straphangers have allowed themselves to be cramped into subway cars by white-gloved officials who are called oshia , which translates to pushing person. this means there are multitudes of bodies pressed against each other. and it also means if you're a disgusting creep, it's an excellent way to get your grope on. but now some female commuters who are tired of being manhandled are fighting back. they're pushing back, in fact. a group of young women at tokyo's shinjuku station have started disguising themselves in oshia uniforms, complete with bell-crowned caps and gloves. they call themselves pushy riot.   while pretending to shove riders, they randomly spank male passengers and squeeze their ticket packages.   pushy riot has created such a swell of controversy - is it female empowerment or criminal aggression? - that even the fashion world is taking note. the famous opi nail polish company has just released two new colors. one is chi chi pusha , chi chi being a japanese word for father as well as slang for breasts. the other is called karmakaze . matt boteen , a spokesperson for opi, says these shades are for the modern girl who's both white-gloved and hands on.
