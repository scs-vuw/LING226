all those weekends president obama is playing golf, he's really playing cricket, at least according to tea party bloggers. conservatives were initially supportive when obama took up the game last year, until someone discovered there was once a cricket field used by diplomats at andrews air force base, one of the military courses the presidential party frequents. those 18-hole games, claims rep. michele bachmann, are a cover for obama's childhood passion, which happens to be the second most popular sport outside of the united states. further proof, his first state dinner last fall honored the prime minister of india, where the sport is huge. quote, "cricket is un-american," bachmann told the minneapolis star tribune. "who plays a sport named after a bug?"
