tom griffith loved to play cheesy country music at his backyard parties to torture his friends, and it doesn't get any more painful than the '70s country trucker hit by c.w. mccall, "convoy." mercy sakes alive, it looks like we got us a convoy.  well, at one particularly buggy barbecue last summer, griffith and his guests noticed that for the few minutes of rubber duck breaker one-ninering, the swarms of mosquitoes disappeared. the song ended. they came back. it started, they left. the group suffered through multiple replays while discussing their discovery, and griffith was given the email address of dan filler who worked with gates foundation's malaria program in africa.  filler, who later said he'd rather pull a two-foot guinea worm from his own leg rather than do this again, tried it on a village boom box. it worked. the mosquitoes fled, then the dogs, the livestock, the women and children.  and finally, even the hardy men could take no more. it's the nails on chalkboard of american music, speculated filler. it might help to eradicate a deadly disease but at the cost of a proud people's dignity? i think not.
