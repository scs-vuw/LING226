wen ju xing understands the hazards of his workplace. like a lot of his coworkers, he's had incidents. he has lost the hearing in one ear, is missing parts of two of his fingers and has twice sustained third degree burns on his face and neck. but that's not what he's upset about. quote, "these are the hazards of working in a fireworks factory," he says. "we all know that. the other situation, however, is unacceptable." the other situation he refers to is that wen ju xing has filed suit for compensatory damages from the hung xiao fireworks company on the grounds that their food is terrible.  : quote, "the burns, the noise, that i understand, but our employer has the obligation to feed us food that does not do to our insides what his product does to our outsides."  : according to wen's suit, several years of unacceptable fare in the commissary have resulted in horrible acid reflux, loss of appetite, and a fast- developing ulcer. and all the heavy sauces, oy, don't get him started. it's enough to make you not want to work around heavy explosives. astoundingly, wen might win. rural courts in china have twice this year already found against employers for inferior food. wen says he doesn't want gourmet food at work, just a little less bang for the buck.
