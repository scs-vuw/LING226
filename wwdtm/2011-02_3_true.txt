what caused some 300 people, many of them armed, to gather on culp city, colorado's memorial plaza this week? corvis mckendrie, whom other culp citians describe as a character, swore to the associated press that, "it was flickie, my nephews' gerbil. i helped the boys wire up flickie's little exercise wheel, so when he ran around in it, he turned another thing that jiggled another thing that pointed to words at random. then we hooked that up to the tweet. it was the boys' science project."  what went out over twitter, at any rate, was this message: "emerge neighbors, denounce old lies in government as revealed here. yes, freedom rises on memorial. gather like eagles next noon by excellent code known." corvis mckendrie absolutely insisted that neither he nor his nephews noticed that the first letters of those words spell out: end oligarhy from glenn beck.  the people who assembled, however, had noticed it, including the misspelling of oligarchy.  "that helped convince me it really was from glenn beck," confessed one of the assembled multitude.  "i was ready to rise up, damn that corvis."
