english legend says that the wizard merlin built the massive stone circle stonehenge for king arthur. giants allegedly helped the wizard to put the stones in place. john rothwell  was just another regular john in the 1980s, knocking around his tiny apartment and riding the motorcycle gang the grave diggers, when he found a book on arthurian legend and was overwhelmed by the similarities between him and king arthur. arthur was a mythic king, a sword puller and a ruler of the round table. john was a biker, a family man and owned a kitchen table. and so, rothwell had his name legally changed to king arthur pendragon. he became a druid and started offering random knighthoods to minor celebrities. he immediately started claiming all that was rightfully his, including stonehenge. the mythical king arthur saved the kingdom from the saxons and tethered his horse to stonehenge whenever he felt like it. reincarnated king arthur pendragon wants a place to park his kawasaki and has spent years petitioning the court for the most coveted prize of all the realm - a free parking spot at stonehenge during the summer solstice. this week, he was finally granted a full day of court time to state his case. legal watchers worry that if modern king arthur wins his case this will pave the way for reincarnated shakespeare to take reincarnated christopher marlowe to court for defamation or for ghost richard burton to divorce liz taylor all over again.
