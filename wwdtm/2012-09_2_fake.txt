for many years, university of california at berkeley entomologist judy talbon simply tossed the skin shed by her pet snake spot. one day last year, while extracting the delicate coral skin from his pen, her graduate assistant stared at the red, yellow and black design and said "that would look badass on my nails."  : and voila, scale nails was born. talbon collaborate with berkeley makeup artist sandy wilmot on a line of nail stickers. the snake skin is laser cut for small, medium and large nails. a set of ten sells for $40. .the line, especially popular with both bikers and park avenue socialites includes: fang, which is rattle skin; squeeze, which is python; and bite me, the exclusive design from her beloved spot, who only sheds twice a year. quote, "that's my boy," talbon told kabc-tv. "he's backordered for three years."
