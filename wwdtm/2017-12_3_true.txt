animal rights organizations have asked that, particularly at christmas time, the production of "cats" present cats more realistically so that fewer cats are returned to shelters because the owners weren't prepared for some of their not-so-cute behavior. the broadway revival production at the neil simon theatre has embraced the request with a variety of creative modifications. the velvet is shredded on the pricey orchestra seats.   the stuffing is scattered across the floor. and when the show opens, the curtain rises on a stage full of actors portraying cats that look as if they have no idea what could possibly have happened.   some audience members seemed put off by the faint smell of urine that permeates the air...  ...all the way into times square.   jennyanydots, known in the original production for trading the mice and bugs late at night, now leaves their entrails around the floor each morning, just waiting for a bare human foot.   old deuteronomy, the elderly jellicle leader, drips pee with every step.   and rum tum tugger throws up repeatedly throughout the show...   ...for no reason. it's not the food. it's not stress. he just does it.
